\"Critic and novelist A.S. Byatt on Tuesday won the Booker Prize, Britain's most prestigious literary award, for her tale of two young scholars investigating the lives of a pair of imaginary Victorian poets.The five judges deliberated two hours before awarding the $39,000 prize to Antonia Byatt for ``Possession,'' one of six finalists in the 21-year-old competition.Television executive Sir Denis Forman, chairman of the judge's panel, announced the prize at a banquet in London's Elizabethan Guildhall, seat of the city's Lord Mayor.``There was very strong individual support for several books on the short list and finally `Possession' by A.S. Byatt was the winner by a majority vote,'' said the judges.Ms. Byatt, who earlier this month won the $43,000 Irish Times-Aer Lingus prize for international fiction for the same work, has published five novels since 1964.In ``Possession,'' she tells how two graduate students piece together the relationship and lives of two imaginary Victorian poets from fragments of their letters and by retracing the poets' journeys across England and to France.Ms. Byatt, born in 1936, is the daughter of a lawyer and sister of novelist Margaret Drabble.A 1978 work, ``The Virgin in the Garden,'' makes allegorical allusions to Shakespeare and other English literary geniuses in a tale of a play performed at a country house.Ms. Byatt taught English and American literature at University College in London until 1983, when she quit to write fulltime.Other finalists this year were 1979 Booker Prize winner Penelope Fitzgerald with ``The Gate of Angels,''They were chosen from a list of 113 books published in the United Kingdom in 1989.The Booker Prize is sponsored by Booker, an international food and agriculture business, and administered by The Book Trust.\",\n"," 7: \"The shortlist of six for the Pounds 20,000 Booker Prize for fiction, announced yesterday, immediately prompted the question 'Who?' from many in the publishing industry.The six include Alan Hollinghurst's The Folding Star (published by Chatto and Windus), a melancholy study of homosexual obsession which was tipped as a likely candidate from the initial 'long list' of 15, The Reef (Granta) by young Sri Lankan writer Romesh Gunesekera and How Late It Was, How Late (Secker and Warburg) by gritty Glasgow realist James Kelman, which was almost universally well-reviewed.As for the other three - Knowledge of Angels (Green Bay) a philosophical fable by children's author Jill Paton Walsh, Paradise (Hamish Hamilton) by Zanzibar-born writer Abdulrazak Gurnah and Beside the Ocean of Time (John Murray) by 72-year-old Orcadian poet George Mackay Brown - 'frankly, they don't make the grade'.The shortlist for the Booker, the UK's most hyped literary prize and one of the most lucrative, is all the more surprising in a bumper year for new fiction fulfilling the criteria - English language and non-American - for consideration for the award.One unsurprising omission from the final selection was When The World Was Steady, a first novel by Claire Messud, which was on the 'long list' before it was pointed out that the author was the wife of James Wood, chief literary reviewer of The Guardian newspaper and a Booker judge.Professor John Bayley, chairman of the Booker panel and husband of former Booker Prize winner Dame Iris Murdoch, expressed surprise at Mr Wood's failure to reveal his relationship with Ms Messud.\",\n"," 11: \"A tornado slammed into a shopping district, a residential area and a school Wednesday, killing at least 15 people, injuring more than 300 and trapping people in cars and homes, authorities said.Cars are piled on top of each other under piles of rubble where buildings used to be,'' said Danny Cooper, state emergency management director in Montgomery.Emergency officials in Huntsville reported 15 confirmed deaths, said Henry Jurnigan, a duty officer with the state Emergency Management Agency in Montgomery.Mayor Steve Hettinger said 305 people were injured and about 500 displaced by the tornado that struck while streets of this northeastern Alabama city filled with rush-hour traffic.Rescue teams with cranes and floodlights searched the rubble through the night for injured or dead.``Several people are still trapped in vehicles and apartment complexes and shopping areas,'' said police spokesman Ben Jennings after the twister touched down between 4 and 4:30 p.m. in the city's south section.The governor dispatched 50 National Guardsmen, along with search and rescue equipment.Rescuers picked through piles of rubble 10 to 14 feet deep, and Cooper said police were unable to determine the extent of the damaged area.Witnesses said the downtown Jones Valley Elementary School, the Waterford Square and adjacent Queensbury apartment complexes were reduced to rubble by the tornado.``The only thing left standing was a door frame,'' news photographer Mike Mercier said of the school, which was empty of staff and pupils when the tornado hit.Authorities said at least five were killed at Waterford Square apartments, three at a business school, Southern Junior College, which is located in a converted movie theater, and others in scattered areas.He said two people were killed when the twister hit house trailers in rural areas east of Huntsville.The city is home to Marshall Space Flight Center and the Army's Redstone Arsenal, but no serious damage was reported from the space agency or weapons testing center.``It came in with a huge roar, an enormous amount of water, and it just started shaking and tearing at everything it could get hold of,'' said real estate broker Ike Carroll, who was in his car when the twister struck.WAAY reported at least one person died when the roof of a business collapsed from winds that overturned cars in the area.The National Weather Service earlier said a tornado hit the east Alabama hamlet of Mellow Valley, severely damaging at least one home and causing some injuries.Weather officials said people were trapped inside a collapsed house.A spokeswoman for the Clay County Sheriff's Department said people were injured at one house in a rural area 30 miles east of Sylacauga.Another tornado touched down about 1:30 p.m. as severe weather swept across much of Alabama and the National Weather Service placed most of the state under a tornado watch.A third tornado was reported shortly before 3:30 p.m. crossing the Coosa River near Titus in east Alabama, the Weather Service said.In Georgia, five people were injured, four critically, and at least 200 people evacuated after a tornado struck two mobile home parks and an interstate highway near Palmetto, about 25 miles southeast of Atlanta, authorities said.Authorities in southwestern North Carolina said a pair of storm-spawned tornadoes struck around 10:45 p.m., destroying a vacant house in Henderson County.The National Weather Service also reported tornadoes inflicting minor property damage in Kentucky and Mississippi.\",\n"," 14: \"A violent storm that spun tornadoes across the South and Midwest blew north Thursday, knocking a cafeteria wall down on top of lunching schoolchildren in upstate New York.The two-day toll was at least 27 dead and hundreds injured.The cafeteria cave-in claimed the lives of seven children near Newburgh, N.Y., and deaths also were reported in New York City, New Jersey and Illinois.Seventeen people died Wednesday in Huntsville, Ala., when a tornado packing 250 mph winds struck virtually without warning, laying waste to a wide swath of the city.By far the worst damage was in Huntsville, where an estimated 1,000 people were left homeless and National Guardsmen stood watch against looting Thursday.The National Weather Service said the tornado path had covered between eight and 10 miles and that its wind speeds were as high as 250 mph.``It's like taking six to 10 city blocks and putting them in a blender and putting it on liquefy,'' said rescue worker Bob Caraway.As the storm moved north on Thursday, it knocked over trees and ripped the the roofs off houses in West Virginia, injuring four members of one family, two seriously.The storm also caused flooding in Washington, D.C., blew the windows out of skyscrapers in Philadelphia and destroyed a house in Piscataway, N.J.A truck driver died when his tractor-trailer overturned in high winds on a bridge connecting Elizabeth, N.J., and New York City.In Wyckoff, N.J., high winds knocked a power line onto a gas line, sparking a fire that forced the evacuation of 20 homes, according to police.The cafeteria collapse occurred at the East Coldenham Elementary School in Newburgh at about 12:30 p.m., when from 113 to 125 students in first, second and third grades were eating lunch, said Newburgh police Chief John Kulisek.State Police and survivors said they believed the school was hit by a tornado, but the National Weather Service said it could not confirm that until investigators went to the scene.``You are talking about huge concrete blocks that fell on top of the kids,'' state police Lt. Robert Hughes said.Seven children ages 7 and 8 were killed and 18 others were injured, four critically, officials said.In eastern Connecticut, more than 75,000 Northeast Utilities customers lost power in the afternoon, and 18,000 remained without power at 9 p.m., spokeman Jeffery Kotkin said.Tornadoes were reported Wednesday in Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Kentucky, Ohio and Indiana.A severe thunderstorm in Illinois claimed one life and caused several million dollars in damage.Altogether, the storms were blamed for at least 27 deaths and more than 500 injuries over the two days.In Alabama, Gov. Guy Hunt said he would ask President Bush to declare Huntsville a disaster area to open the door to millions of dollars in federal relief.Mayor Steve Hettinger said no firm damage estimates were expected until Friday, but he put the number of homeless at 1,000.The temperature, which had risen to 73 before the storm Wednesday, plunged into the 30s early Thursday while rescuers worked through the night under the glare of floodlights.All but one of the victims, who ranged in age from 7 to 67, were killed along Airport Boulevard, a busy thoroughfare that seemed to be a guide for the tornado on its deadly march.The National Weather Service had issued a severe thunderstorm warning at 3:54 p.m., but the tornado struck with no real warning, said Brenda Page of the service's office.A tornado warning was broadcast at 4:39 p.m., two minutes after the twister was sighted on the ground at the old Huntsville airport.\",\n"," 19: 'Tuesday\\'s earthquake, the strongest on the San Andreas fault since the San Francisco quake on April 18, 1906, came in a place that had been identified by scientists just last year as the most likely spot for a major jolt in Northern California within the next 30 years.The epicenter of the temblor, eight miles east-northeast of the city of Santa Cruz in the Santa Cruz Mountains, was at virtually the same spot as earthquakes in the 5-magnitude range that occurred on June 27, 1988, and Aug. 8, 1989.The U.S. Geological Survey, in a 1988 report on regions of high earthquake probability in California, said there was a 30% chance of another 6.5-magnitude earthquake in the immediate vicinity by the year 2018.The report cited even higher probabilities for major temblors on the San Andreas near Parkfield in central California and Coachella in Southern California in the same period, but it pinpointed the Santa Cruz mountains as the most vulnerable spot in Northern California, in part because the area marked the southernmost point of maximum ground slippage during the 1906 earthquake.A period of 83 years is short as far as earthquake intervals go, and during this time, scientists said Tuesday night, pressure was probably building up in the southern neighboring segment of the San Andreas, which had not slipped as much.Thomas Heaton, the Geological Survey scientist in charge of the agency\\'s Pasadena field office, said that the 1987 and 1988 earthquakes now must be seen as \"preshocks\" of the Tuesday\\'s 6.9 temblor.But he joined Caltech scientists in saying that aftershocks as strong as 5.9 magnitude should be expected, and that the pattern of aftershocks could last for months.After both the 1987 and the 1988 earthquakes in the Santa Cruz mountains, the state Office of Emergency Services and the U.S. Geological Survey issued warnings of increased risk of sizable shakes, ranging up to 6.5 magnitude, within the next few days in the vicinity.But these warnings said that if nothing happened, then the chances of a major earthquake would recede to normal for the vicinity.The trouble was, the area was more prone to quakes at this time than any other place in the Bay Area on the San Andreas Fault.Only the nearby Hayward fault may harbor as great a danger of a catastrophic earthquake in the Bay Area.The San Andreas, the longest and best-known earthquake fault in California, extends from Point Arena in Mendocino County to the Salton Sea.Although Tuesday\\'s quake was powerful, Waverly Person, chief of the National Earthquake Information Service in Golden, Colo., cautioned that at 6.9 magnitude, it should be considered only a \"strong\" shock, not a \"major\" one, as a quake in the 7.0 to 7.9 range would be classified, or a \"great\" one, as a quake of 8.0 or above would be.Person and others in the Geological Survey warned Tuesday night that the probability is 40% that a temblor more powerful than Tuesday\\'s will strike in Southern California sometime in the next three decades.But, as it was, Tuesday\\'s quake was about four times stronger than the devastating Sylmar-San Fernando earthquake of 1971 and 10 times stronger than the 1987 Whittier quake.Person said that, like most San Andreas earthquakes, this was most likely to be a strike-slip quake, with one side of the fault grinding horizontally past another.But he said a final evaluation would have to await on-scene inspection teams that will be sent into the epicenter area today by the Geological Survey\\'s Menlo Park office.Jim Dewey, a research geophysicist at the National Earthquake Center, said preliminary evaluations indicated that the fracture was about 10 miles deep, and that the quake rupture extended about 30 miles south down the fault from the epicenter.Person said that the area of strongest shaking was around Santa Cruz, although this evaluation too will have to await field evaluations, as will a final confirmation of the magnitude of the earthquake.The nearest metropolitan area to Tuesday\\'s earthquake, San Jose, has seen nearly a dozen earthquakes of 5 magnitude or greater in the last 10 years, but several of them have been on the Calaveras fault, which generally runs just east of San Jose, more than 10 miles east of San Andreas at this point.Scientists do not yet understand whether the quakes on the Calaveras fault may have been a precursor, or somehow added pressure, on the San Andreas.But in August, 1979, a 6.4-magnitude quake struck under Coyote Lake east of Gilroy and south of San Jose, and since then there have been a number of quakes.They noted that a similar series of moderately strong quakes had preceded the San Francisco quake of 1906.Meanwhile, a New Mexico scientist who studies tidal forces, supported by two eyewitnesses, said Tuesday night that at a private lecture in San Francisco on Oct. 10, he had stated that a strong quake in the vicinity was probable on or about Oct. 16.',\n"," 23: \"Private groups and officials from Tokyo to London to Charleston, S.C., offered help to the ruptured San Francisco Bay area, but some said relief for the earthquake could drain coffers already strained by previous disasters.Los Angeles, long San Francisco's West Coast competitor but equally at the mercy of the San Andreas Fault, quickly shipped doctors, sonic equipment and fire investigators to the Bay Area.The mayor of a sister city in disaster, Charleston's Joseph P. Riley Jr., sent a plane load of drinking water, a symbolic return of the support his city got after Hugo.The Salvation Army had the food cooking almost before the earth quit shaking in Northern California, while the Red Cross opened the doors and unfolded cots in 25 shelters.According to Ferraez, the organization dispatched 12 mobile canteens to the hardest-hit earthquake areas within minutes.All Salvation Army centers in the Bay Area, including 34 community service centers and scores of other units, have been turned over to the relief effort.The Bay Area has a large Asian population, and callers from Japan and the Philippines and other countries jammed phone lines trying to reach relatives.The Osaka, Japan, city government announced it was sending $10,000 to San Francisco, a sister city since 1957.Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley sent police and fire investigators to assess damage from the quake, and convened his own emergency council in a special meeting to discuss other possible measures.``We all know the horrors of an earthquake and we express our deep-felt sympathy for the people of the San Francisco Bay area.''An Anheuser-Busch Inc. brewery in Fairfield, 35 miles northeast of San Francisco, interrupted normal operations to fill cans with drinking water instead of beer for free shipment to relief agencies, the company said.Coast Guard offices across the West Coast provided San Francisco with as many boats and helicopters as could be spared, said Coast Guard spokeswoman Elizabeth Neely.The Red Cross sent 290 units of blood from Los Angeles; the San Diego Blood Bank rushed 50 units to San Francisco within an hour of the quake; more than 400 units were sent from Portland, Ore.Even the Internal Revenue Service got into the act, announcing it would waive penalties for taxpayers unable to file returns or make scheduled payments because of the earthquake.President Bush directed $273 million in immediate aid for quake victims and said he would visit the area Friday or Saturday.The Red Cross began its fiscal year July 1 with $18.5 million in its disaster budget, and had spent 40 percent by September.Then Hugo came along, triggering an effort the agency estimates will cost $42 million _ the most ever.``When a major earthquake and a major hurricane hit back-to-back, you can bet it will stretch Red Cross disaster resources and manpower,'' said Bob Vessey, director of disaster services in Washington, D.C.\",\n"," 42: \"Here is a transcript of the speech by Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas nominating Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana for vice president at the Republican National Convention on Thursday night.Mr. Chairman, four of my congressional colleagues and I are here for the purpose of nominating the next vice president of the United States.We are here to nominate one of the bright young lights in the Republican Party, a man I am proud to say is my colleague, the junior senator from Indiana, Dan Quayle.Well, three years ago, I received a handwritten plea from a 6-year-old girl who after several days of long, long Senate sessions had a very special problem.Corinne and her brothers, Tucker and Benjamin, and their mother, Marilyn, share Dan Quayle with the people of Indiana and the United States Senate.And whenever I needed him, whenever I needed him, Dan was there _ ready and willing to make the tough choices, to cast the tough votes, to transform President Reagan's vision of America into the law of the land.Whether it was the budget or defense, tax reform or the INF treaty, Dan Quayle was there, a forceful advocate, and a staunch supporter of the Reagan revolution.And believe me he is ready, and just let the Democrats try to use experience as a measuring stick in this campaign.He's got plenty of experience, plenty of experience _ experience in raising taxes again and again, experience in vetoing the pledge of allegiance in public schools, experience in increasing spending year after year after year in Massachusetts.And I just don't believe the American people want that kind of experience in the White House.He's already spent 12 years as a congressman and a senator, tackling the vital national and international issues that affect the lives of all Americans and the future of our country.\",\n"," 44: \"Republican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle's official resume says he was the Indiana Consumer Protection Division's chief investigator a year before the unit was created, state records show.The law creating the unit passed April 14, 1971, and took effect July 1.Officials said Quayle served as chief investigator from July until mid-September, when he became administrative assistant to then-Gov. Edgar D. Whitcomb.Quayle's Senate biography, which his campaign is using as his official background, says he was chief investigator of the unit in the Attorney General's office from 1970 to 1971.``He was assigned to our section in the spring of 1971,'' said Robert Smith, the unit's first director and now an attorney in Indianapolis.Quayle conceded Friday that the resume entry was ``inaccurate'' and said his staff had written the document.Earlier, however, Quayle spokesman David Prosperi called the revelation of the error by The Plain Dealer of Cleveland ``a cheap shot.''Quayle was hired as an entry-level research assistant by the state Attorney General's office in 1970 after he returned from six months of basic and advanced training for the Indiana National Guard.M. Stanton Evans, then an editor with the Indianapolis News, helped arrange his job interview with the state.Theodore Sendak, the Attorney General at the time, recently had surgery and is unable to comment, according to his son, Timothy Sendak.Patricia Gifford, a Marion Superior Court judge who was then an assistant attorney general, said Friday that prior to the establishment of the Consumer Protection Division, ``all complaints and inquiries were handled by me.The Consumer Protection Division was created by the state legislature to resolve complaints over defective products, false claims in ads, faulty speedometer readings and mail-order fraud.The statement referred to periods when Quayle was in basic training and 15 days of camp each summer.\",\n"," 46: 'One year after his election, Dan Quayle has achieved all he ever wanted: He has become dull.During his entire campaign for the vice presidency, Quayle refused all requests from such national interview shows.That joke was not only funny, but it got to the heart of a strange phenomenon: Americans didn\\'t give a damn about the vice presidency (Mike Dukakis tried to make Quayle a major issue and failed), but some also felt that Quayle wasn\\'t qualified for a job that had no qualifications.It was the 42nd anniversary of the show and we wanted someone above and beyond the usual guest.\"I asked David Beckwith, his spokesman, why Quayle had waited so long to go on a major interview show.The selection of Dan Quayle had been Bush\\'s first major (and some would say only) decision of his presidential campaign.And now was the time for Quayle to go on \"Meet the Press\" and show everybody just how right George Bush had been.',\n"," 51: 'Iran said today that it would welcome relief offered by its bitter enemy, the United States, to help victims of the earthquake that has killed as many as 35,000 people, the State Department said in Washington.Boucher said Iran told the U.S. government that private donor agencies should contact the Iranian Red Crescent, a humanitarian group that is the conduit for all outside assistance.Iranian authorities have told United Nations officials that about 35,000 people died in the earthquake.Iran reportedly said it would accept aid from all countries -- including Iraq -- but excluded Israel and South Africa.Rescuers in Iran today freed thousands of people from buildings flattened by the earthquake in northern Iran, which struck early Thursday and had a magnitude between 7.3 and 7.7.The Islamic Republic News Agency said 6,000 people were pulled from rubble and airlifted from the stricken Gilan and Zanjan provinces to hospitals.Iranian television showed scenes of devastation, including the remains of an entire row of hillside village houses that collapsed and slid down the hill.The Iranian Red Crescent asked for help in providing shelter for 400,000 people left homeless by the earthquake.The death toll was higher than a quake that killed 25,000 people in nearby Soviet Armenia in December, 1988, and a quake in Iran in 1978 that also killed 25,000.The state-run television interviewed one middle-aged man from Roodbar, a mountainside village in Gilan province, who said he was sleeping when the temblor struck.',\n"," 52: \"Setting aside years of animosity, the U.S. government joined with private humanitarian groups Friday to funnel medicine, tents, clothing, food and other relief materials to help earthquake-stricken Iran.State Department officials said the government gave $300,000 worth of supplies to the American Red Cross for shipment to Iran -- including 1,000 hard hats, 1,000 pairs of leather gloves, 10,000 face masks, 2,940 wool blankets and about 500 tents.The U.S. military, which often is used to ferry relief supplies to countries in need, stood ready to offer transport planes and logistics support for any U.S. aid requested by Iran.Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani, who toured the stricken region Friday, also appealed for international aid.Pat Davis, a spokesman for the American Red Cross in Washington, said Friday that although the Red Crescent is highly organized and well equipped, the large number of dead and suffering people has forced the Iranian agency to solicit international assistance.The American Red Cross responded by mobilizing its local offices to solicit money, informing its toll-free telephone operators to request earmarked donations for the earthquake victims and sending $50,000 in cash to the Red Crescent Society to be used to help needy Iranians.Andy Griffel, executive director of American Jewish World Service, said directors of the assistance organization participated in a conference call Friday morning to debate whether to collect money for the Iranian victims.Acknowledging Iran's strained relations with many nations, Zamani said his country is attempting to ease the antagonism to deal with the disaster in the country.Dwain Schenck, a relief worker for AmeriCares Foundation, said the Connecticut-based relief group expects to send 80,000 pounds of medical supplies, two doctors, a nurse and about half a dozen relief workers to Iran today.\",\n"," 54: \"An anti-American newspaper in Iran said Sunday the United States is partly to blame for the death of tens of thousands of people in last week's earthquake.The ``criminal role of America in Iran's past became evident once again in the recent earthquake,'' the Jomhuri Islami said in an editorial reported by the official Islamic Republic News Agency.``Our people, even under the rubble, chant `Death to America' and pray to God to cut off the hands of the United States ... even those hands stretched out to help,'' it said.It argued that by ``plundering Iran's oil and other resources'' for 25 years, the United States had prevented the use of even a small part of the national wealth for urban development projects and ``advanced (anti-seismic) building construction systems.''``Even after its expulsion from Iran, the U.S. government by imposing economic sanctions and launching several other plots, halted the renovation of the country,'' the editorial added.The newspaper was implying that with these actions the United States had blocked the diversion of funds to earthquake safety measures.``If the United States has real humanitarian objectives and intended to help the Iranian nation, it should do only one thing, stop hatching plots,'' the newspaper said.It called on Iranians to reject relief offers by the United States and ``other governments whose hands are stained with the blood of the Iranian people.''Iran, at odds with the United States since the 1979 seizure of hostages at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, has said it would welcome relief from the American Red Cross and other U.S. humanitarian groups.\",\n"," 61: \"INDIA suffered a fresh wave of terror last night when an explosion destroyed two blocks of flats in the centre of the city of Calcutta, killing at least 45 people and injuring scores of others.Police said a bomb exploded in the crowded trade and residential district of Bowbazaar shortly after midnight, causing two blocks of flats to collapse and trapping up to 70 people in the rubble.The identity of the bombers was unknown but the explosion comes just five days after over 250 people were killed and at least 1,200 injured in a series of bomb attacks aimed at the heart of the Indian business capital of Bombay.A militant Sikh group fighting for independence for the Indian state of Punjab has claimed responsibility for the Bombay blasts, but police are unconvinced, saying they were carried out by a foreign group in connivance with 'local criminals'.In what many interpreted as a reference to Pakistan, with whom India has fought three wars, last week Mr Shankarrao Chavan, the federal home (interior) minister, told parliament in New Delhi that he suspected 'an international conspiracy.'Most of the estimated 125 people living in the Calcutta flats were in their beds when the blast occurred, setting fire to both buildings, according to officials in the city's central control room.Among the targets were the Bombay Stock Exchange, the landmark Air India building, a shopping complex, and two hotels near the airport.The attacks in Calcutta and Bombay are a severe setback to attempts to heal the wounds created by recent intercommunal violence, which has caused deep shock throughout India.More than 2,000 people died in riots, including over 700 in Bombay, after the razing of a mosque at Ayodhya in northern India by Hindu zealots on December 6.Last night national and local state leaders appealed for calm in an attempt to prevent a renewed outbreak of violence.\",\n"," 62: \"The 29-storey Jijobhoy Towers, home of the Bombay Stock Exchange, was rocked by two powerful bombs last Friday, leaving 60 dead and 200 injured.The market reopened on Monday in an attempt to return to normal.It has had to compromise - trading has been restricted to an hour a day, and dealing has moved back to the traditional ring, where it stopped a year ago.All this has taken place against a volatile background: the Bombay equity market, over the past six weeks or so, has had to contend first with unusually bullish speculation, before the national budget on February 27, and subsequently with some savage expressions of disappointment.He did reduce excise and import duties on a broad front, but left out the cement and steel sectors, where share prices had been boosted by pre-budget speculation.He lowered the tax to 30 per cent from 65 per cent for expatriate Indians and foreign investors but for local investors it remained at 44.5 per cent.Taking the tax concessions for granted, traders had driven up share prices in February to make a kill later.While industry and business welcomed the statement which, for once, did not propose any new tax, Professor Rusi Taraporewala, the stock market theorist and academic, said a reduction in import duties would leave corporate profits ex-growth this year.The relative lack of financial concessions meant that disappointed traders sold with a vengeance and, until the weekend, the market seemed bottomless as equity prices plummeted to a 13-month low.Overseas investors fuelled the downtrend as they sold some half a million shares of Reliance Industries, arbitraging between the share price on the Bombay stock exchange and the market price of its Euro-issue of global depository receipts (GDRs).At the current conversion rate of Rs31 per US dollar, the Reliance GDR fetched Rs170 per share against the BSE quotation of Rs210.The BSE 30-share index plunged by more than one-fifth to 2,287 on March 10, from 2,893 at the post-budget trading session on February 27.Share prices rebounded last week, taking the index to 2,361 and the uptrend, on balance, has continued this week in spite of the bomb blast on Friday.They are hoping that foreign portfolio investment will pick up with the restoration of trading after 'Black Friday', and the successful sale of Reliance stock on the BSE by international investors.In this, they are more fortunate than they were in previous years, when they were under pressure to take advantage of a long-term capital gains tax exemption before the financial year ended in March.The exemption has been replaced by a flat 20 per cent tax this year which, according to dealers, puts bulls and bears on an even footing.\",\n"," 79: \"Unidentified assailants hurled a grenade and fired shots today at the home of relatives of Nelson Mandela, killing a

Govindesamy Mariemuthoo said the attack occurred before dawn at the home of Monde Mandela in the black township of Soweto.ANC officials said the dead child was the great niece of Mandela's father, making her a distant cousin of Nelson Mandela.The ANC officials said Nelson Mandela was close to the Monde Mandela family.An ANC statement said, ``The ANC notes the curious coincidence of an attack on a man bearing the Mandela name at this time.''Given the distant connection between Mandela and the family, police said they did not know if the attack was deliberate or just a random attack linked to the general violence.Mandela was reportedly attending a political meeting in the eastern province of Natal today.Soweto and other black townships around Johannesburg have been hit by black factional fighting that has killed about 800 people since August.The fighting has pitted followers of the ANC against Zulus of the conservative Inkatha group.Mandela has repeatedly accused security forces of manipulating the violence to derail government efforts to end apartheid and share power with the black majority.Mandela was released in February after 27 years in jail for opposing the white minority government.He is closely guarded by ANC operatives, and there have been reports of threats on his life in recent months.Mandela and other ANC leaders have been negotiating with President F.W. de Klerk to pave the way for full-scale talks on ending apartheid, the South African system of racial separation.\",\n"," 80: 'World leaders welcomed South Africa\\'s announcement Saturday of Nelson R.

Food and Agriculture Organization reported today.The agency projects world cereal production in 1988 to total 1.785 billion tons, only two million tons more than last year's level, which was already below the expected production.If the drought in the United States ended now, grain production would fall close to the low levels of 1983, when a drought and farmers' participation in a government crop reduction program decreased output, the agency reported.As a result, world grain stocks are projected to fall below 310 million tons, or 17 percent of the level the agency considers necessary to safeguard world food security, the report said.If crop conditions in the United States and Canada continue to deteriorate, the ratio could drop even further.The high grain prices resulting from a lower supply would hit poor, food-importing countries the hardest, the U.N. agency warned.In Asia the yearly monsoon rains started on time, and production in Europe and the Soviet is expected to be

the center of the storm.The weather service issued a flash flood watch for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands until at least 6 p.m. Sunday.Strong winds associated with the Gilbert brought coastal flooding, strong southeast winds and up to 12 feet feet to Puerto Rico's south coast.San Juan, on the north coast, had heavy rains and gusts Saturday, but they subsided during the night.On Saturday,

throughout the day and was on track to later strike the Cayman Islands, a small British dependency northwest of Jamaica.Meanwhile, Havana Radio reported today that 25,000 people were evacuated from Guantanamo Province on Cuba's southeastern coast as strong winds fanning out from Gilbert began brushing the island.All Jamaica-bound flights were canceled at Miami International Airport, while flights from Grand Cayman, the main island of the three-island chain, arrived packed with frightened travelers.``People were running around in the main lobby of our hotel (on Grand Cayman) like

Montego Bay on the west and Ocho Rios on the east, far from the southern impact zone and separated by mountains, was expected only to receive heavy rain.Forecasters at the center said the eye of

Royal Marines Music School outraged Britons and stirred recriminations over safety standards at the school.A huge explosion in a barracks staff room Friday morning leveled the three-story building as bandsmen took a coffee break between practice sessions on the school's parade ground.Twelve of the 22 people injured were hospitalized, eight of them in serious condition, police said.Although trainees at the school range in age from 16 to 20, Col. John Ware, principal director of music, said the slain bandsmen all were trained, adult musicians.The outlawed Irish Republican Army, engaged in a 20-year-old campaign to drive the British from the province of Northern Ireland, claimed responsibility in a telephone call to Ireland International, a Dublin news agency.Residents of the area adjoining the Marines school said Friday that despite government calls for stepped-up public alertness against terrorists, security at the school had eased noticeably.``Anyone in Deal will tell you how easy it is to get into the base,'' said Fred Verge, a 70-year-old army veteran.``There is a great sense of anger'' in the community, Kent police Chief Constable Paul Condon said.The Royal Marines Music School is one of 30 military establishments in Britain that use private security firms, Defense Ministry figures show.Unidentified defense sources quoted by the Times newspaper today said the civilian guards were backed up by armed Marines who patrolled regularly inside the perimeter.Defense Secretary Tom King promised a security review and said new measures had already been taken at the base.Martin O'Neill, the opposition Labor Party's spokesman on defense, said on Friday: ``Serious questions must be asked about the penny-pinching policy of the Ministry of Defense, which may well put our armed services at dreadful risk.''``If we designate places as being low-risk categories, then it is likely they will be attacked, given the way that the IRA is forced to operate,'' O'Neill added.Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher received news of the bombing while aboard a jet over Siberia en route from Japan to Moscow.The defense minister, anger clearly written on his face, said that rather than erode the will of the security forces, the attack ``redoubles their determination to ensure that terrorism cannot win.''Prime Minister Charles Haughey of Ireland condemned the attack and sent Mrs. Thatcher a message of sympathy at ``this outrage ... which has caused severe and tragic loss of life and many injuries.''The mainly Roman Catholic IRA claim gave no details of the operation, but said it was a response to a ``message of war'' delivered by Mrs. Thatcher when she visited Northern Ireland nine days ago.It was an apparent reference to her speech praising the locally recruited Ulster Defense Regiment as ``a very, very brave group of men'' who have lost 179 members in IRA attacks since 1970.The mainly Protestant UDR is regarded by many Catholics as a sectarian force, and is at present under a cloud over allegations that some recruits leaked names, addresses and photos of IRA suspects to Protestant assassins.\",\n"," 119: 'The Los Angeles Sports Council, in a bid to bring Super Bowl XXVII to the Rose Bowl in 1993, will offer the stadium to the National Football League rent-free in a proposal next Monday.The Sports Council, which represents the Los Angeles-Orange County area in trying to bring major sports attractions here, also will offer the NFL all income from concessions and the sale of novelty items.Under a joint agreement, the Coliseum and Anaheim Stadium did not submit competing bids, but they would share in the revenues if Pasadena gets the game, said Ed Aghjayan, Pasadena\\'s deputy city manager.\"The bulk of the revenue would go to the Rose Bowl, but the idea is that we would share with the Coliseum and Anaheim,\" Aghjayan said.One plan calls for the Rose Bowl to receive 75% of the proceeds, with the two other facilities sharing 25%.Pasadena earned $300,000 from the 1983 Super Bowl and $800,000 in 1987, the money coming from stadium rental fees, concession sales, admission taxes, charges for use of a hospitality tent compound and parking fees.In addition, the city was allowed to buy 1,200 tickets at face value for local distribution by directors and other city officials.But as bidding for the Super Bowl has become more competitive, the NFL has taken more of the income, Aghjayan said in a report to the city\\'s Board of Directors.Under the proposal for the 1993 game, the city would give up most of the previous sources of revenue and allocate them to the NFL.It also would provide 350,000 square feet of space for the league to build a hospitality tent compound.The city would receive about $79,000 from seat taxes, $75,000 in hotel and sales taxes arising from the event and a share of about $55,000 in parking fees.The Rose Bowl, meanwhile, has proposed an $8.3-million project to renovate the press box and restructure about 1,000 seats for club seating, with an

co-chairman of one of the featured events of Super Bowl week, the Bambaleo Parade, a Saturday extravaganza with marching bands, a street festival and floats.This year, the Super Bowl Task Force, a group headed by two of the city\\'s most influential white businessmen, named two black men to head a community-relations committee.But perhaps most important, Carley said, several minority-owned businesses have won lucrative contracts from the NFL for the game.About 100,000 visitors, many of them corporate and political movers and shakers, were expected to arrive in Tampa this week for the festivities leading up to the game Sunday.The game itself, which is televised to 750 million people around the world, is only part of an event whose impact on a city has been compared to that of a national political convention.Hotels, restaurants and other businesses are anticipating an estimated $125 million in revenues, with a total economic impact of $200 million.\"The Super Bowl introduces you to the world in a big way,\" said Barbara Casey, the coordinator of the Super Bowl Task Force.Last month, NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said he would stand by his recommendation to move the 1993 Super Bowl out of Tempe, Ariz., because the state does not have a holiday honoring Dr. Martin Luther King.A week before the Super Bowl in Miami two years ago, the fatal shooting of a black man on a motorcycle by an Hispanic police officer in the predominantly black Overtown neighborhood set off three days of looting and torchings of buildings and cars.While the disturbances were not caused by the Super Bowl, the NFL was criticized at the time for not making enough of an effort to include minority-group members in the festivities.In Tampa, Super Bowl XXV brought about the cancellation of what was the biggest annual event in the city for 86 years: the Gasparilla Parade, an extravaganza that featured 500 of the city\\'s most powerful men swaggering through the streets dressed as gun-toting pirates.Tampa officials made the parade part of their pitch to the NFL for the Super Bowl.But after Tampa was awarded the 1991 Super Bowl, a racial dispute erupted over the parade, which always has been sponsored and organized by an all-white, all-male private club, Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla.The Super Bowl Task Force had to scramble to put together a new parade, and Carley became the co-chairman of that effort.Super Bowl XXVI will be played Jan. 26, 1992, in the Metrodome.The last time the Super Bowl was held in a cold-climate city was in 1982, when the 49ers beat the

have been formed at the beginning of time.Less than five hours after it rode into space aboard the shuttle Discovery on Tuesday, the $1.5 billion telescope sent its first test radio signal.Hawley's job on Wednesday will be to drop the telescope overboard for a 15-year stay in space.Discovery, trailing an arc of white smoke into a brilliant blue sky, carried the silver-colored telescope to an orbit 380 miles above Earth _ higher by 70 miles than any previous shuttle.There the Hubble will stay to search for yet-unseen wonders of creation with instruments that can look 14 billion years backward in time.NASA launch commentator George Diller exulted as the Discovery rose off its seaside launch pad.``It's a beautiful day to have Hubble Space Telescope in orbit instead of here on Earth like it's been for so many years,'' said NASA administrator Richard Truly.The telescope was supposed to be launched in 1983, but technical problems and the Challenger accident delayed its deployment.It suffered a further delay two weeks ago when the countdown was stopped at the four-minutes-to-go point because of a faulty hydraulic unit on the shuttle.While it remained on Earth, the telescope cost $7 million a month to exercise and keep in readiness.In its first day in space, that checkout and testing continued remotely under control of the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland.On hand to watch the Discovery launching was a contingent of scientists who have hailed the Hubble as the greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo raised a small telescope to his eyes nearly 400 years ago.Truly referred to the early-day astronomer when he was asked about the long delays in getting the telescope to its working station.``Somebody the other day said, `Who remembers the day that Galileo picked up his telescope to look at the stars?''' said Truly, a former shuttle astronaut.When it flies free, it will receive electrical power for its six scientific instruments from two wing-like solar arrays that extend outward on each side.That gave support to the theory that a massive explosion _ the Big Bang _ created the universe 10 to 20 billion years ago.The Hubble is expected to help provide the answer to two major questions: How old is the universe?On Wednesday, Hawley is to grapple the 12{-ton telescope with the shuttle's mechanical arm, lift it out of the cargo bay, point it, and _ after a long checkout _ drop it overboard to orbit on its own.Should the solar panels not deploy, mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan will be standing by, partially dressed in space suits, ready to go into the open cargo bay to unfurl the arrays manually.With 31 seconds left in the countdown, the computer that runs the final moments before liftoff refused to close a fuel valve and stopped the launch process.The problem was overcome and the shuttle lifted off at 8:34 a.m. EDT, about three minutes late.The shuttle is scheduled to land Sunday at 9:49 a.m. EDT at Edwards Air Force Base in California.He said the windshield was streaked by the debris and that it also was smeared when the spent booster rockets fell off during the climb to orbit.The astronauts also had problems with their UHF radio circuit, and one of the ship's small rear thrusters was inoperative.\",\n"," 161: \"Ground controllers at the Goddard Space Flight Center finally made contact today with the two main antennas on the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope after trying for more than six hours to lock on.Applause erupted in the Hubble control center in Greenbelt, Md., as the glitch that marred Hubble's first full day in space was solved.Engineers had said all along they believed the antennas were working all right and that the problem was in incorrectly pointing either the satellite or the TDRS, an orbiting communications satellite that acts as a switchboard.In the successful attempt, they nearly doubled the width of the antennas' beams to take in more territory, from a sweep of 6.2 degrees to 10.8 degrees.Space shuttle Discovery was 46 miles away, available to remedy certain problems.Steve Terry, director of a team calibrating various aspects of the telescope, said the first outage was caused by human error and was not a serious problem.It began between 1 and 1:30 a.m. EDT and lasted 45 minutes to an hour, he said.The second failure occurred at 6:44 a.m. when controllers attempted to send a signal to the telescope's two high-gain antennas through the TDRS.The telescope, embarking on a 15-year search for new worlds, was released from the shuttle's cargo bay Wednesday after a last-minute snag that almost sent two astronauts on an emergency spacewalk.Mission Control awakened the crew early today with a loud rendition of the song ``Shout,'' a fraternity house favorite.After Wednesday's deployment, Shriver gently backed Discovery away from the telescope and put the shuttle through a series of maneuvers, the last one completed this morning, to ``park'' Discovery in orbit 46 miles behind Hubble.NASA's most expensive unmanned spacecraft _ as the greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo raised a small telescope to his eyes nearly 400 years ago.Discovery and its five astronauts will follow the telescope while controllers at the Goddard center make sure Hubble is operating properly, such as responding to directional commands.The next milestone is Friday, when the telescope's 10-foot aperture door is to be opened, exposing the finely polished 94.5-inch mirror to starlight.Then on Tuesday, NASA expects to release the first image from the telescope: an open star cluster in the constellation Carina.If the aperture door doesn't open properly, Discovery could return to the telescope so two astronauts could perform a spacewalk to fix it.Hubble project manager Fred Wojtalik said the telescope would be tested today for its ability to maneuver before the aperture door is opened.On Wednesday, mission specialist Steve Hawley used the shuttle's 50-foot robot arm to gently grasp the 12{-ton telescope and hoist it from the cargo bay.One of the telescope's solar arrays unreeled from its mast as expected and started providing power to the telescope's batteries, which otherwise had only eight hours of charge.By the final attempt, astronauts Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan were in their space suits in the airlock, 30 minutes away from taking tools in hand and going on an outer-space maintenance call.The 8{-hour procedure was performed 380 miles above Earth, 70 miles higher than any shuttle has ever flown.Astronomers hope to use the telescope to look back to almost the beginning of the time, studying stars and galaxies so distant their light has taken 14 billions years to reach Earth.The telescope originally was scheduled for launch in 1983 but was delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident.Discovery, which blasted into orbit Tuesday, is scheduled to land Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.\",\n"," 162: \"The shuttle that put the Hubble Space Telescope into orbit also carries an instrument used in the 1920s by astronomer Edwin Hubble: the eyepiece from what once was the world's most powerful telescope.``It's a great pleasure to have something of such historical significance and something that so directly symbolizes Edwin Hubble's fundamental contributions to astronomy,'' astronaut Kathy Sullivan said Friday as she circled the Earth in space shuttle Discovery.The eyepiece from the Mount Wilson Observatory's 100-inch Hooker Telescope was carried into orbit by Sullivan.``It's basically a symbolic gesture from the past of astronomy to the future of astronomy,'' said Lyn McAfee, spokeswoman for the Mount Wilson Institute.The Pasadena-based group runs the observatory, located in the San Gabriel Mountains outside Los Angeles.``The discoveries made by Hubble on the 100-inch telescope at Mount Wilson gave us a giant leap forward in our understanding of the universe,'' McAfee said.The Hooker Telescope was the world's most powerful telescope from its construction in 1918 until 1948, when the 200-inch Hale Telescope was placed in operation at Mount Palomar Observatory northeast of San Diego.Using the Hooker Telescope, Hubble was the first to determine the distance to a galaxy outside the Milky Way, the institute said in a statement.``This crucial discovery provided the first definite proof that other galaxies existed far beyond the confines of our own local galaxy,'' the institute said.During the 1920s and 1930s, Hubble and an assistant used the Hooker telescope to take thousands of photographs of faint galaxies, showing that most of them were moving away from each other very quickly.``This provided observational evidence for the concept, suggested by Einstein's Theory of Relativity, that the universe is expanding,'' the institute said.The Hooker Telescope was mothballed in 1985 by the Carnegie Institution, former operator of the observatory, in a money-saving move.\",\n"," 172: \"Margaret Thatcher set the example of what a woman could achieve in British society, but her critics say she did little else to help women along.One woman wrote to The Independent newspaper last week that her 7-year-old daughter wondered what title Mrs. Thatcher's successor would hold, since ``he couldn't be called prime minister, that's a girl's name.''Emma Nicholson, a Conservative Party lawmaker, said it was once unthinkable that a woman would ever be a British prime minister.Mrs. Thatcher, who stepped down on Thursday, urged women to get involved in politics, but did little to pull them up the ladder.Several female lawmakers were appointed to junior executive posts in various ministries, but the only woman to serve in a Thatcher Cabinet was Baroness Young, leader of the House of Lords from 1981 to 1983.Edwina Currie, a former junior health minister, said any other prime minister would have had several women in and out of the Cabinet.Trree men are vying to succeed her as Conservative Party leader and thus prime minister in a vote by party lawmakers set for Tuesday.Traditional male attitudes remain strong in Britain, from the upper-crust, all-male clubs of London to the topless women pictured daily in the tabloid press.``The critical mass of women have entered middle management in government and business,'' said Lesley Abdela, a founding member of the 300 Group.The group seeks equal representation for women in the 650-seat House of Commons, which now has 43 female members.Women represented 43 percent of the British labor force in 1988, compared with 40 percent in 1979 when Mrs. Thatcher became prime minister.Though Mrs. Thatcher never made a priority of women's issues, she did introduce some helpful legislation: tax concessions for workplace nurseries; independent taxation for married women; and legislation to compel absent fathers to pay child benefits.Angela Rumbold, the Conservative Party's minister for women's issues, contends that an ``enormous amount'' has been done for women during the Thatcher years.Jo Hawkins of the 300 Group, which is seeking equal numbers of women in the House of Commons, believes Mrs. Thatcher's extraordinary abilities made it difficult for her to understand the needs of the average woman.\",\n"," 179:

sixth-grader Binh Hoang, who was born in Vietnam in 1975 in the final days of war and had never before heard gunfire.Police said a drifter identified as Patrick Edward Purdy, 26, armed with two

on the ground near a pool of blood and the gunman's body.The gunfire startled Michael Cuevas, whose first thought was that the University of the Pacific fraternities near his house were firing their miniature cannon again.``I never thought a tragedy of this magnitude could happen in Stockton,'' said Cuevas, a 29-year-old marine clerk at the Port of Stockton who lives down the street from the

some analysts believe the consequences of a political and economic German superstate could have an unsettling effect throughout Europe.The lifting of travel restrictions by East Germany on Thursday has breathed new life into the idea of a single German state, drawing expressions of support from the Bush administration and others.But Soviet affairs expert William Hyland says that despite these assertions, a reunified Germany is ``really terrifying to most of the countries involved, to the West Germans, to the United States, Soviet Union, Poland and Czechoslovakia.``No one really wants German unity except the East German people, and they turn out to be the decisive factor,'' says Hyland, a one-time top aide to former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger.It was just 2{ months ago when ceremonies were held commemorating the 50th anniversary of the start of World War II, a time when a unified Germany initiated what was to become the slaughter of more than 50 million people.While a recurrence of that nightmare seems remote at best under any scenario, an undivided Germany could become the unchallenged economic and political force on the continent.The official U.S. policy on the reunification question was outlined last Thursday by State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher.``Reunification has been supported by NATO and by the United States for 40 years, and our strongly held view is that reunification or reconciliation between the peoples of Germany must take place in peace and freedom,'' he said.As former National Security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski sees it, the reunification issue will become ``very, very active'' if a freely elected government takes power in East Germany.Brzezinski asks: ``How do we arrange for the unification of Germany, so that it doesn't become destabilizing, so it isn't a threat to Germany's neighbors _Theodore Sorenson, a top aide to President John F. Kennedy when the Berlin Wall was built in 1961, says he hopes a reunited Germany will be forged as part of a reunited Europe.Reunification, Sorenson says, ``will pose problems, because we couldn't afford to have a reunited Germany outside the Western Alliance.Rogers notes that Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev has said the nations of eastern Europe can do what they want so long as they stay in the Warsaw Pact.``If East Germany stays in the Warsaw Pact, NATO, with the best of its ability, would try to prevent full reunification; maybe a confederation between the two Germanys, but not a full reunification,'' Rogers says.``There must be some serious apprehension in the Soviet Union today, because the events of the last couple of days certainly has made reunification more likely.''The Bush administration says it does not foresee the dismantling of NATO under any circumstances but, according to Hyland, the reunification of Germany could mean the demise of the alliance.``It may also mean the end of Western European unity, because both have been based on a divided Germany and a divided Europe,'' Hyland says.``If that comes to an end and 80 million Germans are united in a confederation or a single state, it changes the entire map of Europe.\",\n"," 188: \"The government on Thursday allowed for the possibility of a reunified Germany, but said such a state must be formed gradually and respect Poland's borders.In the Solidarity government's first definitive statement on the issue, Foreign Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski told Parliament the two German states could be joined as part of the process of uniting Europe.Asked about German reunification at a news conference in Gdansk, Solidarity labor leader Lech Walesa said he prefers ``no political changes in Europe, but there should be all kinds of economic integrations.''Western European countries have agreed to form an economic union by the end of 1992.Sweeping democratic reforms have taken hold in East Germany in the past several weeks under the pressure of mass protests, spurring talk of reuniting the two German states divided at the end of World War II.The specter of a powerful, reunited Germany has troubed many Poles, especially the older ones who recall the 1939 Nazi invasion of Poland that began World War II.A reported surge in anti-Polish sentiment in East Germany in recent weeks has heightened Polish anxieties.Skubiszewski faulted West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's program for gradual German reunification, offered last week, for not making clear that reunification would respect the existing border between Poland and East Germany.Some right-wing West German politicians have called for recovering the 40,000 square miles of territory that Germany lost to Poland at the end of World War II.East Germany and West Germany each separately has recognized the border, but there has been no official assurance that a reunified Germany would also acknowledge the border.He also said German reunification is unlikely as long as West Germany belongs to NATO and East Germany to the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact military alliance.\",\n"," 197: \"Sir, The argument for an independent central bank is that it should be free of party political interference, not that it should conduct monetary policy without regard to national, regional or global interests.As the western German population is now aware, German reunification needs a strong, growing west German economy to finance the subsidisation of eastern Germans' living standards until there is a sustained upswing in the east - even if at the cost of higher German inflation than the Bundesbank would wish.The governments of Europe have been remarkably patient with the Bundesbank, although it is threatening nearly 10 years of European effort for greater economic and political integration.It is ironic that, just when German reunification presented a short-term reason for Germany to shift its anti-inflationary economic and monetary priorities, accommodating European convergence, Bundesbank intransigence is threatening the EMU commitment.The German government might point out to the Bundesbank that monetary targets might be achievable only at the cost of many more than 3m unemployed in Germany, of the destruction of the EMU programme and global depression.The European currency bloc is overvalued against the dollar and yen as a result of Bundesbank interest rate policies.A future European-wide central bank must clearly - like the US Federal Reserve - be more accountable in the broader European political and economic interest.The governments and central banks of Europe and the G7 block - including the Kohl administration - should pressurise the Bundesbank, and be prepared to consider constitutional changes if necessary, to halt this idiocy.\",\n"," 201: 'Robert Maxwell, the flamboyant billionaire who built a global publishing empire, was found dead Tuesday in waters off the Canary Islands, where he had been vacationing on his yacht.Authorities said Maxwell, 68, who earlier this year had bought the New York Daily News, vanished overnight from the 180-foot Lady Ghislaine.His unclothed body was found several hours later.Maxwell\\'s death ended the reign of a contentious media baron who battled unions, barked out orders in eight languages and bullied editors as he built a $2 billion media conglomerate.the Citizen Kane of his time,\" said British Conservative Party lawmaker Anthony Beaumont-Dark, referring to Orson Welles\\' classic movie about a publishing baron, presumed to have been William Randolph Hearst.The Czechoslovak-born Maxwell, who escaped the Holocaust and emigrated to Britain in 1940, personally ran his publishing empire, often making minute-to-minute decisions.\"What normal people consider pressure was meat and drink to Robert Maxwell,\" said Charles Wilson, editorial director of Maxwell\\'s Mirror Group Newspapers.His death prompted immediate concern in British financial circles about the future of his debt-laden empire and in New York about the future of the Daily News, one of the nation\\'s largest metropolitan papers.Among Maxwell\\'s assets were the Macmillan publishing house in New York, Britain\\'s No. 2 paper, the Daily Mirror, The Daily Record, and The European and British Printing &ampOn the steps of Mirror Group Newspapers in London, Ian Maxwell told reporters the moment was tragic not only for his family but also for Maxwell\\'s thousands of employees.His body was found 20 miles northwest of Grand Canary Island after an extensive air-and-sea search, officials at the rescue center in Madrid said.The body was taken by helicopter to the Gando air base on Grand Canary Island, where it was identified by Maxwell\\'s wife of more than 40 years, Elizabeth, and their son, Phillip.He was last seen alive on the deck of his yacht at 4:45 a.m. EST, Daily News spokesman John Campi said.At 11 a.m., a business call arrived from New York, and the crew discovered that Maxwell was not aboard.His mysterious death came as Maxwell was embroiled in an international controversy, something common in a life that had the improbable, extravagant and sometimes mysterious character of British fiction.Maxwell had just been accused in a book by reporter Seymour Hersh of having close ties to the Israeli secret service.',\n"," 217: \"What the relays demonstrate more clearly than any other athletics event is that at the Olympics the race has traditionally gone to affluent countries -

Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is scrambling to make sure Oscar's golden sheen isn't tarnished by Hollywood hucksterism.``If you know about an infringement and fail to object to it, you risk having your trademark become public domain,'' said Bruce Davis, the Academy's executive administrator, in explaining the lawsuits the organization has filed to protect its beloved hunk of electroplated pewter.But despite the Academy's crusade against crass commercialism, this year's awards ceremony will feature a new merchandising wrinkle: Some 800 limousines delivering the most famous stars to the Oscar telecast will be equipped with door-mounted coolers jammed with Diet Coke, Coca-Cola Classic and other Coca-Cola Co. beverages.When the limo doors swing open in front of the Shrine Auditorium and the celebrities tumble out, the Coke logo will be on display in front of an audience that includes millions around the world.When MGM-UA, the distributor of ``Rain Man,'' published newspaper advertisements touting the film's Oscar nominations before the nominations were even announced, the Academy issued a harsh statement condemning MGM-UA's promotional gamble.For nearly 50 years, the Academy has maintained strict security around both the nominations and the award winners.The Collector's Book Store, local sponsors of monthly entertainment memorabilia auctions, has sold off seven Oscars in the past year, including the best picture trophy for 1951's ``An American in Paris'' ($15,760), Marlon Brando's best actor prize for 1954's ``On the Waterfront'' ($13,000) and the black and white interior decoration Oscar for 1941's ``How Green Was My Valley'' ($17,715).When Malcolm Willits, the book store's owner, announced that he would hold a February auction for the 1957 best-picture trophy for ``Around the World in 80 Days,'' the Academy said enough, initiating a court action that, for now, has blocked any future trophy sales.The Academy insists that a contract signed by Oscar winners mandates that they will not sell the trophies without first offering them to the Academy for a nominal fee.``But now that the word is out that these awards are worth $10,000 to $50,000, people are reluctant to sell them back to the Academy for $10,'' Willits said.Now, you can go into Beverly Hills homes and there's a movie poster, and the darn thing's worth $10,000 or $20,000 dollars.''Yet the Academy has lost its most recent attempt to save its trophy's integrity: A copyright infringement suit brought against the Houston International Film Festival was dismissed March 16 in a California federal court.The Academy had claimed the Lone Star Statuette, designed and built by Chicago's Creative House Promotions, was ``practically identical'' to the Oscar.\",\n","

year in this decade.\"Rain Man\" did win the grand prize (and three other big ones) and \"Mississippi Burning,\" with just one Oscar for cinematography, did get punished for its highly publicized historical muddling.But gone, for a refreshing change, was the slate voting that has turned many recent Academy Awards shows into one-note evenings that kept some deserving people out of the Oscar resale market.\"Rain Man,\" its director Barry Levinson, Hoffman and the screenwriters (the two of several who worked on it) may have fulfilled their roles as favorites, but there were no sure things elsewhere, and people looking for early patterns had to throw away the form.Whether the spread represents a change in voting habits, or an absence of a film to rally around, it made for a great show and in some cases, the awards helped right some wrongs in the nominations process.That \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" won three of the six awards for which it was nominated may save the academy some embarrassment for neglecting the one 1988 film sure to be regarded as a classic.The voters tend to favor those films that are both of substance and commercially successful (thus: \"Rain Man\"), and whether they even bother to see the other nominees is often questioned.More surprising were the awards given to \"Bird\" and \"The Milagro Beanfield War,\" films that divided critics and sent moviegoers off to the video store looking for alternatives.Both films were flawed, but the sound editing done for \"Bird,\" which seamlessly blended old jazz recordings with fresh studio cuts done by contemporary musicians, was brilliant and deserved the award its four-man sound team won.The selective mood of the voters is a reflection of the kind of year the film industry had, and whether the spread is a quirk, one can hope it suggests a trend.The 1988 slate of films was, on total, a marked improvement over recent years.',\n"," 229: 'Tank-led troops quickly seized the ruler\\'s palace and

Security Council on Monday voted to impose broad economic sanctions against Iraq for invading small oil-rich Kuwait.The measure forbids loans to Iraq or Kuwait and prohibits any activities, including the transfer of money, that would help the two countries export their goods.Sanctions adopted by the European Economic Community on Saturday froze Iraqi assets and suspended the purchase of oil from the two Arab countries.More than 90 percent of imports from Iraq to the 12-nation EEC are petroleum products.Switzerland, which is not a member of the United Nations, made the unusual move Tuesday of joining the U.N. sanctions and banned all trade with Iraq and Iraqi-occupied Kuwait.Japan's participation in the U.N. sanctions was seen as especially key since Tokyo usually has taken a low profile in the Middle East, which supplies much of its petroleum needs.China joined the U.N. decision to embargo arms sales to Iraq, but has been less vocal than other major countries in condemning the invasion.Cyprus' sacrifice in joining the embargo was to give up 70 percent of its oil imports, government spokesman Akis Fantis said.Cyprus has sufficient oil supplies to last until the end of August, he said, but ``we are already in the process of taking steps to secure alternative sources ...''The worldwide closing of ranks against Iraqi oil imports is likely to lead to even higher petroleum prices, which have already risen dramatically since the invasion and could have a major impact on the world economy.France will introduce controls Thursday on prices of petroleum products to prevent refiners from using Iraq's invasion of Kuwait as an excuse to raise prices, acting Premier Pierre Beregovoy announced Tuesday.An official with the Petroleum Association of Japan said he was unaware of any increase yet in the price of gasoline for consumers.The official, who refused to be further identified, said it would be at least three months before the sanctions could be expected to force higher gas prices in Japan.\",\n"," 238: \"Retired Sen.

Joseph Montoya, D-N.M., on his way home from work.On Friday, Tower authorized the release of a statement that recent hospital tests showed no evidence of alcohol abuse, and Vice President Dan Quayle said, ``I have never seen drinking being a factor in John Tower's life other than a social glass of wine.''Eggers, meanwhile, acknowledged that there was ``no question'' that Tower sometimes drank too much in the early 1970s, but he said: ``He is not an alcoholic.\",\n"," 251: \"Here is a brief chronology in the dispute between Iraq and Kuwait over oil production and their common border.July 17 _ Iraqi President Saddam Hussein accuses Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates of flooding the oil market and driving prices down, and that the move cost Iraq $14 billion in lost oil revenue.He further charges that Arab states in the Persian Gulf are conspiring with the United States and Israel to weaken Iraq's economy and undermine its military buildup.July 18 _ Iraq accuses Kuwait of stealing $2.4 billion worth of oil from wells along the disputed border with Iraq and of seeking to wreck Iraq's economy by overproducing oil and thus pushing down prices.July 20 _ Kuwaiti officials suggest Iraq's sudden outburst of belligerence is aimed at getting its creditors _ including Kuwait _ to write off billions of dollars in debts from the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.July 24 _ The U.S. Defense Department announces that U.S. Navy warships and aircraft are holding a ``short-notice exercise'' in the Persian Gulf with the United Arab Emirates, about 600 miles southeast of the Kuwait-Iraqi border.Kuwait reinstates a state of alert it declared July 16 and canceled after three days of tension between the two oil-producing countries.The Iraqi government in Baghdad says that it will not be intimidated by U.S. pressure in its oil dispute with neighboring Kuwait, and Saddams summons the U.S. ambassador for talks.President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt says Iraq and Kuwait plan to meet in Saudi Arabia in an effort to resolve their dispute.July 26 _ OPEC ministers in Geneva agree to halt overproduction in hopes of pushing up the price of crude oil.July 31 _ Kuwaiti and Iraqi delegations meet in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, to negotiate the oil and border dispute.Diplomats say Iraq has massed 100,000 troops on Kuwait's border, more than triple the number originally estimated.Aug. 1 _ Iraq pulls out of talks on the 2-week-old border, oil and money dispute with Kuwait shortly before it sends its forces to invade the oil-rich sheikdom.Iraq's powerful army overruns Kuwait before dawn with tank-led troops quickly seized the ruler's palace and other government buildings.\",\n"," 253: 'Iraq struck back against the West today, rounding up hundreds of foreign nationals in Kuwait, as the U.N.

heavy rains and floods which typically hit China from the south to the north from June to August.Earlier reports said that successive torrential rainstorms in the Xijiang and Beijiang river valleys in early and mid-June resulted in a big flood, one of the most serious in 100 years, in Guangdong Province and caused heavy losses.In an urgent conference late yesterday, the Guangdong provincial government urged localities to help flood victims with food, shelter, clothing and medical care so that no one would die of hunger and no epidemic disease would break out in the flooded areas.The

overthrow the country's Islamic leadership say.``The regime is very much fearful of public outrage,'' said Shahin Gobadi, spokesman for the People's Mojahedin of Iran.As Gobadi spoke Friday, members of the organization denounced Iran's government at a noisy rally held in a park across the street from the White House.Northern Iran was stuck Thursday by an earthquake measuring between 7.3 and 7.7 on the Richter Scale.Iran has told the United Nations that the death toll is at least 36,000, but Gobadi said his organization has received estimates closer to 100,000.Gobadi said the country cannot properly assist earthquake victims because its treasury has been spent in a war with neighboring Iraq and against internal opposition.Sympathy for the earthquake victims was a secondary issue for the chanting, flag-waving rally participants, who also carried signs criticizing their native country.Planning for the event began three weeks before the earthquake, but part of the Friday's activities focused on Iran's stricken residents.Gobadi said shoddy housing in which the government forced people to live was the cause for the widespread loss of life.This regime has devoted all of its resources to a senseless war with Iraq and to oppression of the people at home,'' he said.Iran's Islamic republic was established in 1979 after Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was deposed by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and militants seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, taking 66 Americans hostage.The shah died in exile in July 1980, U.S. hostages were freed six months later and Khomeini died last June.Gobadi said his 25-year-old group had helped depose the shah but had no part in organizing the Islamic republic.``Even in this tragedy for which we grieve we cannot trust the regime in Iran,'' Rep. Mervyn Dymally, D-Calif., told an estimated 3,000 people attending the rally.Dymally, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, praised President Bush's offer of humanitarian aid to Iran but said Bush must make sure the assistance is channeled through non-government groups.The State Department said Friday that Iran was willing to accept earthquake relief from the American Red Cross and other U.S. humanitarian organizations.\",\n"," 272: 'Shortly after 2 p.m. Wednesday, San Diego resident Mohammad Nyakoui got a call from his wife, who is spending the summer in the Caspian Sea coastal city of Rasht, Iran, with her family.About 15 minutes after she hung up, Rasht and other cities in Iran\\'s northern region were rocked by an earthquake that killed thousands.Back home in San Diego, it was several hours before Nyakoui even heard news of the quake.\"I tried through the Red Cross to call Iran, but they told us they couldn\\'t do anything before 48 hours passed.\"One of about 25,000 San Diego Iranians in the same anxious state, Nyakoui was luckier than most: His wife managed to call him a second time that day, about eight hours after the quake, to tell him she and their two children were safe.Hamid Biglari, a theoretical physicist at UC San Diego, was among those who organized a local group to gather contributions for the United Nations Fund for the Iran Earthquake.Another group gathering medical supplies is Southwest Medical Teams, an organization whose last major international effort was sending volunteers and medical supplies to Armenia after the 1988 quake there.Southwest Medical Teams won\\'t be sending any volunteers this time, said director Barry La Forgia.Collecting antibiotic and analgesic drugs, collapsible plastic water containers, plastic sheeting, 220-volt portable generators of less than 10 kilowatts, tents, blankets, dry food, light clothing, flashlights and lighting equipment.Bring items or mail checks to 4540 Kearny Villa Road, Suite 214, San Diego 92123;

that could make insurers less likely to slash premium rates further in coming months.For the time being, the losses from Hugo \"will be substantial, but they won\\'t be something the industry can\\'t handle,\" said Charles L. Ruoff, director of strategic planning at Fred S. James &amp; Co., a New York-based insurance broker.For instance, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. estimates it will pay claims totaling more than $400 million to homeowners and for some small businesses.Nationwide Insurance Co., a mutual company based in Columbus, Ohio, said Hugo \"is the single largest claims disaster\" it has seen in its 63-year history.The company, which is the largest home and auto insurer in North Carolina and No. 3 in South Carolina, has already received 16,000 claims from the stricken region.New York-based Continental Corp., which is a big insurer in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and South Carolinas, said it will take a $50 million pretax charge against earnings this quarter, reflecting its net exposure to the damages caused by the hurricane.Philadelphia-based Cigna Corp., which has extensive domestic, foreign and reinsurance operations in the areas Hugo hit, and USF&amp;G Corp. in Baltimore, a big insurer in the Carolina region, could also be forced to take one-time charges against third-quarter earnings, analysts said.Both USF&amp;G and Cigna declined to predict whether they would take a charge; USF&amp;G said it would be responsible for the first $22.5 million of losses, and its reinsurance would cover the bulk of additional losses.Hugo could have a marginal impact on third-quarter income at Travelers Corp., Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Insurance Co. and Chubb Corp., according to industry analysts.Mr. Ruoff at Fred S. James believes that even if losses from Hugo total as much as $5 billion, insurers won\\'t feel enough \"financial pain, such as not being able to pay shareholder dividends,\" to compel them to boost premium rates right away.He explained that in the first six months of this year, net income for the industry declined slightly from 1988, but insurance companies were still earning an adequate rate of return on equity.He also noted that the industry\\'s aggregate net worth or policyholders\\' surplus, currently at $125 billion, is also plentiful.Niagara Exchange Corp., based in Buffalo, N.Y., said Monday it will report a loss from operations for the third quarter, and possibly for the year, because of the substantial losses that its Charleston Insurance Co. unit faces as a result of the hurricane.',\n"," 316: \"It's taken the devastation caused by Hurricane Hugo to stimulate repayment of a 211-year-old debt between two cities almost 1,000 miles apart.As a way of repaying a kindness dating to 1778, Kingston is raising money to help Charleston, S.C., recover.After Kingston, then New York's capital, was burned in October 1777 by the British, New York Gov.

Swiss lawyers before she visited Switzerland earlier this month.The reports did not say when criminal charges against Marcos, Aquino's ousted predecessor, will be filed or when Mrs. Aquino will allow him to return.Mrs. Aquino's government has said it will file criminal charges against Marcos, whom it has accused of stealing up to $10 billion in government funds.But the government has not done so because of Mrs. Aquino's refusal to let Marcos enter the country.Swiss lawyers are helping the Philippine government trace money that Marcos and his family allegedly placed in Swiss bank accounts.Marcos has been living in Hawaii since he was toppled by the civilian-military revolt that swept Mrs. Aquino to power in February 1986.The Swiss government has frozen the assets of Marcos and his associates and has not released information on them to the Philippine government because of legal challenges posed by Marcos' lawyers and Swiss banks.The unidentified Swiss lawyers said the information will not be turned over ``unless and until there is an assurance that formal charges will be filed against him,'' Benigno was quoted as saying.Swiss law allows the lifting of banking secrecy laws only in case of criminal prosecution.Mrs. Aquino has said she would allow Marcos to return now only if he and his family swore allegiance to her government and returned the money he allegedly stole during his 20-year rule.She said later she would abide by any court decision if Marcos' lawyers in the Philippines raised the matter of his return to the courts.Benigno was quoted as

officials.Mrs. Aquino, comparing the task of strengthening the heavily indebted Philippine economy to the recovery of West Germany after World War II, asked that Germany share its experience with her homeland.``We have tried by sound fiscal policies not to buy recovery at the price of inflation, nor debt relief at the price of national honor,'' she said in a speech to the West German Chamber of Industry and Trade.``We have paid as careful attention to the consequences of runaway inflation and devaluation as Germany in the light of her own experiences between the wars,'' she said.Mrs. Aquino said the Philippines' debt was projected to increase to $29 billion by year's end but that much was money that ``was in fact stolen by the previous government'' of ousted dictator Ferdinand Marcos.She said that since her government took over in 1986, the country's growth rate of minus 10 percent under Marcos in 1985 had improved to a rate of plus 6.7 percent by 1988.``What we need to complete the equation are two elements essential to the German recovery _ debt relief and investments,'' Mrs. Aquino said.During a state banquet in the evening, Weizsaecker told Mrs. Aquino her visit would further strengthen relations between West Germany and the Philippines.Weizsaecker said the Philippines have had good results in trade with West Germany, and assured Mrs. Aquino that the barrier-free market

for which, surprisingly, he has the support of RAH, the state-owned coal mining company - are less obvious.The ministries of industry and finance are conducting investigations into charges of fraud and embezzlement by Mr Cosma and several senior RAH company officials.Ministry of Industry officials argue the strike could be an attempt to divert attention from the investigations.In recent months, Mr Cosma has claimed he has evidence that senior government officials, including President Ion Iliescu, called miners to Bucharest as part of plans to consolidate their own power.It remains to be seen whether those involved in the incidents of 1990 and 1991 now feel confident enough to ignore him.\",\n"," 360: 'Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin today pressed ahead with a sweeping purge of coup supporters, and the Communist Party suffered a series of stunning blows for not opposing the coup plotters.Gorbachev threw out his foreign minister, Alexander Bessmertnykh, and the Communist Party was banned from the KGB, which for decades helped enforce Communist rule.Gorbachev told an audience at the Russian parliament that the government would prosecute those responsible for the takeover.He accused the Communist Party Central Committee of panicking during the coup.Gorbachev and Yeltsin, the Russian Federation leader who saved Gorbachev, met today for the first time since the coup collapsed to discuss the takeover and deal with officials who backed the putsch.Yeltsin has been a strong foe of Communist Party influence in the countryGorbachev also told the Russian Federation parliamentarians that the leaders of the hard-line coup had sought to arrest Yeltsin.As the face of the Soviet government continued to change in the aftermath of the 63-hour coup, hundreds of angry citizens marched toward Communist Party headquarters in Moscow intent on proving the party was behind the coup.Yeltsin, who led the nationwide coup resistance, today nationalized the hundreds of printing plants in the Russian republic.He suspended the publication of six Communist Party newspapers and ordered new chiefs for the official Novosti and Tass news services, charging that they had supported the takeover.The actions by Yeltsin, who quit the party last summer, came amid a growing wave of anger at the Communist Party, six of whose top party officials were arrested for instigating the coup.In a major blow to the crumbling party, the acting head of the KGB today banned Communist Party activity in the security service, Tass said.As Gorbachev and Yeltsin met, a crowd of about 1,000 people headed toward the Communist Party headquarters in Moscow, saying they wanted to capture and preserve records that might prove the party supported the coup.Calls for retribution have sounded since the 3-day-old coup collapsed Wednesday, with Gorbachev beginning a purge of coup plotters and thousands of cheering demonstrators toppling a statue outside the Moscow headquarters of the KGB, whose former leader backed the ouster attempt.Bessmertnykh, 57, was the latest official to step down or be removed after the failed takeover.In in his speech to the Russian Federation parliament, Gorbachev said of Bessmertnykh \"this morning I got information that at least he was trying to maneuver or worse\" during the coup attempt.Yeltsin, who stature rose with his resistance in the coup, said earlier that he would insist that proven reformers be installed in top jobs.Gorbachev told the legislators that he did not want now to name all those appointed to replace the hard-liners, but Yeltsin said that Gorbachev had agreed to appointing Maj. Gen. Constantine Kovets head of the army.(check) Gorbachev said he would meet today with leaders of the nine republics who support the new Union Treaty.The treaty, whose signing was put off by the coup, had angered hard-liners who objected to its provisions ceding more Kremlin power to the republics.Kirghiz President Askar Akaev said the republic of Kirghizia would take control of the headquarters of the Kirghiz wing of the Communist Party and the local Lenin Museum.(check) Only one of the eight top leaders of the coup remained at large early today -- Oleg Baklanov, deputy of the state Defense Committee.',\n"," 369: \"TOMORROW evening, just before the Olympic closing ceremony, the last and one of the most prestigious events of the Games will be held.Run in high heat, high humidity, high pollution levels and over an extraordinary course, the Barcelona Olympic men's marathon will prove one of the most physically demanding ever run.It is estimated that when the race begins in Mataro, a seaside town north of Barcelona, the temperature will be an already-uncomfortable 25`C. Towards the marathon's end, however, radiant heat thrown off by buildings could be subjecting the runners to a temperature of up to 30`C.

made a televised statement of concern; signed a disaster proclamation; received a written report from the Federal Emergency Management Agency; and visited FEMA headquarters.On his FEMA visit, Mr. Bush said that he hoped there would be \"less carping\" about the emergency office\\'s performance this time, adding that the agency \"took a hit\" for its reaction to Hurricane Hugo.',\n"," 374: \"Most San Francisco-area homeowners may have to pay for damage from Tuesday's earthquake out of their own pockets, while insurance companies may reap long-term benefits from higher rates, industry spokesmen and analysts said Wednesday.Only 15 percent to 20 percent of California homeowners have earthquake insurance, which typically requires a 10 percent deductible and costs between $200 to $400 a year for a $100,000 home, according to industry spokesmen.The Association of California Insurance Cos. in Sacramento said that in the San Francisco area roughly 25 to 30 percent of the homes have earthquake insurance.Insured homeowners without earthquake protection will get reimbursed only if their homes were ravaged by fire, which is covered under basic homeowner insurance polices, said Hugh Strawn, director of catastrophe services at the Property Loss Research Bureau in Schaumburg, Ill.Insurance companies attempted Wednesday to assess the amount of quake-related damages they're likely to have to pay.In addition to home damage, the companies likely will get claims for automobile damage, broken glass, theft and burglary, business interruption due to electrical outages, water damage and, possibly, workers compensation.Industry analysts predicted insurers would be able to reverse three years of declining rates and win rate hikes from state regulators due to the quake damages and the estimated $4 billion in damages from Hurricane Hugo, which hammered South Carolina and other parts of the southeastern United States earlier this month.``There's a perception that this could turn the cycle ... that this could be enough to firm pricing,'' said Gloria L.

Sakharov a traitor, but a Moscow weekly has now provided a sympathetic portrait of the human rights activist and his wife.This week's issue of the newspaper Moscow News said that Sakharov long ago understood the need for change in the Soviet Union.The article makes a clear attempt to refute some of the past charges leveled at Sakharov and his wife, fellow dissident Yelena Bonner, by Soviet officials and the state-controlled media.Moscow News also pointedly notes that the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize winner has praised Mikhail S. Gorbachev's campaign for social and economic reform.The 66-year-old Sakharov and his wife lead a frugal existence in their seventh-floor Moscow apartment, eating cabbage, beet soup, potatoes and other simple fare, and Sakharov insists on washing the dishes afterward himself, the paper said.It said their two-room home was always filled with people seeking Sakharov's aid, and that the words most often heard there are: ``Help me.''Although the full-page article was the longest on Sakharov to date in the Soviet press, it made only indirect reference to the nearly seven years he spent in exile after criticizing the Kremlin's intervention in Afghanistan.Sakharov, a brilliant physicist, was allowed to return to Moscow in December 1986 from his forced residence in the closed city of Gorky, where he was banished without trial in January 1980.``In effect, sometimes Sakharov bitterly jokes that he'd like to return to Gorky for a few months to be able to work alone on scientific work,'' Moscow News said.Since his return to Moscow, Sakharov has been a vocal supporter of Gorbachev's program for nationwide reforms that includes the policy of ``glasnost,'' or greater openness on selected topics.``He simply believes that something helped change the thoughts of the majority into state policy,'' Moscow News said.However, Sakharov has insisted on speedier progress in improving the Soviet record on human rights, and during a Jan. 15 meeting in the Kremlin, he handed Gorbachev a list of 200 people he said were imprisoned for their views.Moscow News noted that in 1975, in a tract titled ``Knowledge and the World,'' Sakharov set forth his views on Soviet affairs.``Now we can definitely see parallels between what he said then, and those ideas that we are putting forward today,'' Moscow News said.The human rights activist, one of the most prominent members of the dissident movement that reached its peak in the 1970s, sought openness in Soviet society years before ``glasnost'' became Communist Party policy.Much of the Moscow News article seemed designed to undo harm caused to the Sakharovs by previous press campaigns against them.It said one Soviet book accused the Sakharovs of living in ``oriental luxury'' and engaging in ``scandals between spouses.''Moscow News said Sakharov was stubborn, unassuming, an undisputed member of his country's intelligentsia and a man with his own views on how to deal conscientiously with world affairs and the demands of this life.His strong convictions even extend to his insistence that he do the dishes after meals, wrote the reporter who visited Sakharov at his apartment.\",\n"," 380: \"The visit by human rights activist Andrei D.

Gorbachev allowed him to return to Moscow in December 1986.Some statements and articles by Sakharov have been printed in the Soviet media since then, including an article last week in a magazine that opposed some elements of Gorbachev's blueprint for political and electoral reforms.Other activities by Sakharov have gone unreported here, including his delivery to Gorbachev of a list of 200 Soviets reportedly held in prison, labor camp or psychiatric hopsitals because of their political views.The official Tass news agency reported Wednesday that the organization Sakharov belongs to _ the International Foundation for the Survival and Development of Humanity _ held its first session in Boston the previous day.\",\n"," 386: \"In what amounted to a public apology, Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Soviet leaders today eulogized Andrei D. Sakharov as a ``man of honesty and sincerity'' who suffered great injustice at the hands of previous rulers.An obituary signed by Gorbachev, five other members of the ruling Communist Party Politburo and 50 other leading officials and scholars was printed along with a picture of Sakharov on page 4 of the party daily Pravda.Such obituaries are reserved for favored public figures and scientists, and Pravda emphasized the importance of the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize winner by printing a decree about the formation of a funeral commission in a black box on its front page.Sakharov, 68, died Thursday night in his study, just hours after urging fellow members of the Congress of People's Deputies to create a formal opposition to the party in their drive to break its seven-decade strangehold on political power.The obituary noted Sakharov was exiled in the industrial city of Gorky about 250 miles east of Moscow from 1980 to 1986.It was signed by Gorbachev and fellow Politburo members Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, Vadim A. Medvedev, Lev N. Zaikov, Alexander N. Yakovlev and Vitaly I. Vorotnikov.However, the signatures of several other Politburo members, including KGB chief Vladimir A. Kryuchkov and leading conservative Yegor K. Ligachev were missing.Ligachev, interviewed by the Tass news agency on Friday, had said he disagreed with Sakharov but respected him.It was Leonid I. Brezhnev, now blamed by Gorbachev for permitting stagnation and corruption to overcome the Soviet system, who exiled Sakharov for criticizing the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan.Gorbachev called Sakharov in Gorky in December 1986 and told him he could return to Moscow.The Soviet leader told reporters at the Congress of People's Deputies that Sakharov's death was a ``great loss.''Even though the two often tangled at the Congress, Gorbachev said he respected Sakharov.``He was not some sort of political intriguer,'' the Soviet president said Friday.Several hundred people gathered outside Sakharov's apartment building Friday evening, holding candles and wreathing his photograph in flowers.Memorial services were scheduled Sunday at the city's main youth center, and on Monday at the Lebedev physics institute where Sakharov worked and the Academy of Sciences, of which he was a leading member.The obituary also praised Sakharov's vision as a scientist, which made him the youngest-ever member of the Academy of Sciences at age 32 and led to his inclusion in a group that developed the Soviet hydrogen bomb.\",\n"," 388: \"Mourners sobbed and shook their heads in disbelief Sunday as tens of thousands viewed the flower-draped body of Andrei D.

Sagdeyev, a member of the official funeral commission, said about 3,000 people an hour were arriving initially, but the official news agency Tass said that rate doubled later, making for a total of 45,000 by nighttime.``I would not wish a living person _ he has lived an animated, happy life _ to be turned into an icon, an icon which could be used by various forces in their interests,'' Bonner said in an interview broadcast on Soviet TV.She said, however, that she hopes Sakharov's writings, published abroad long ago, will become widely available in his homeland so there can be a conversation of ``the people of the future with Andrei Dmitrievich.''``He was like the man from one of Maxim Gorky's tales who used his own bleeding and living heart as a torch to lead people to light and truth,'' said the woman, a teacher who declined to give her name.``Sakharov always was telling the truth and by doing so forced our leadership to do the same,'' said Boris Sorokin, a 50-year-old designer.Outside the offices of the weekly newspaper Moscow News on Pushkin Square, a popular gathering place for political activists, portraits and flowers were displayed.An entry in a notebook for mourners' comments outside Sakharov's apartment building declared, ``The conscience of the nation has died.''an organ of the official press, which had branded Sakharov an ``utterly ignorant person'' _ took the rare step Sunday of publishing a special edition devoted to the activist.Four pages were filled with pictures of him, condolence telegrams from exiled writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn and President Bush and a text of Sakharov's last public remarks, a speech he delivered hours before his death in which he said the Soviet hierarchy was ``leading the country to a catastrophe.''``History's most peaceful rebel, in dying, did not come down from the cross, but left a horrifying hole in the moral fabric of the world.''President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other Soviet leaders said in an obituary that Sakharov had been the victim of ``gross injustices'' and praised him as a ``man of honesty and sincerity.''Bonner, Sakharov's constant companion and fellow human rights activist, sat closest to the coffin, clutching a black handbag and periodically closing her eyes.Gorbachev was expected to pay his last respects Monday, when the funeral is planned, and on Sunday was represented by Yevgeny M. Primakov, chairman of the funeral commission and a non-voting member of the country's ruling Politburo.The foreign dignitaries expected to take part in Monday's ceremonies include Lech Walesa, head of Poland's Solidarity movement, who will be making his first trip to the Soviet Union, and former refuseniks Yosef Begun and Vladimir Slepak, who now live in Israel.\",\n"," 394: \"Deaths from heart and blood vessel disease dropped 24 percent over the past decade, but it remains by far the nation's biggest killer, taking a life every 32 seconds, the American Heart Association said Sunday.``The good news is that we continue to see an improvement in the death rate from the biggest killer of our population,'' said Dr. Bernadine Healy of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, who is president of the heart association.``The bad news is that heart disease is still killing almost 1 million Americans a year, and we've got a long way to go.''``The public ought to appreciate the progress that has been made in heart disease over the past 20 years,'' said Dr. Myron L. Weisfeldt of Johns Hopkins University.However, Weisfeldt, who is president-elect of the heart association, also cautioned that much work remains, both in improving care and encouraging people to take better care of their health.``I believe we can prevent at least 50 percent of the ischemic heart disease in the United States by the year 2000 if we stop smoking, get cholesterol treated if it's above 220, and identify and treat hypertension,'' he said.Association figures indicated that in 1986 _ the most recent year for which there are statistics _ an estimated 978,500 Americans died from heart attacks, strokes and other diseases of the heart and blood vessels.The association's figures show that more than one in four Americans suffers some form of cardiovascular disease, and almost half of those eventually die from it.About 60 percent of the heart attack deaths occur before the victim reaches the hospital.Studies show that about half of all heart attack victims wait more than two hours before getting to an emergency room.Weisfeldt said a major health goal is getting people to go to the hospital within three or four hours of the first sign of heart attacks.Other major goals, he said, include finding ways to improve the effectiveness of angioplasty, a technique that uses balloons to open clogged heart arteries, and finding surgical and medical techniques to identify and protect people at risk of cardiac arrest.The heart association estimates that cardiovascular disease will cost $88.2 billion this year in medical expenses and lost wages.\",\n"," 401: \"Official newspapers, which once denounced the Beatles as harmful pests from the decadent West, joined a worldwide celebration and ran stories of tribute about the late John Lennon, who would have turned 50 on Tuesday.Two concerts devoted to the songwriter, guitarist and singer, who was shot to death in 1980, were held in Moscow.An anchorman, more accustomed to reading official government news, reported on the worldwide Lennon birthday bash and called his song ``Imagine,'' an ``anthem of peace.''The celebration was a dramatic turnabout from Soviet authorities' repression of Beatles fans and supression of their music in earlier times.About 1,000 Soviets, mostly second generation Beatles fans, flocked to the Moscow Electrical Lamp Factory's cultural hall in northeastern part of the city to rejoice in Lennon's music.A plaque outside the hall reminded Beatles fans that Lennon's near namesake, Vladimir Lenin, the founder of the Soviet state, had spoken at the spot in 1917 and 1919.Inside, fans listened to recordings of Lennon's music, attended a concert of about a dozen Soviet rock bands, bought his albums and posters and reflected on his life.``He's like a hero, a symbol for every person: a symbol of honesty, talent, devotion to his ideals, notion of love, equality between people and goodness,'' said Irina Dykomkina, the 21-year-old secretary of the Sgt.Andrei Trushkin, a correspondent for Komsomolskaya Pravda - the Communist Party youth newspaper that devoted a full page Tuesday to Lennon - said he appeals to Soviet youth in part because he was a rebel, like many of them, and was a ``difficult teen-ager.''The stage was adorned with a painting of Lennon and life-size cardboard cutouts of the Fab Four in front of the British flag.Onstage, the groups Sprint, Quiet Hour and Optimal Variant played in Beatles style but were joined by a group that didn't quite fit in the genre, an American-style country ensemble that wore plaid vests and performed ``Night Train to Memphis.''\",\n"," 404: \"The arrangement continued until Lennon told the woman he called ``Mother'' it was time to make music again.``Double Fantasy'' followed just before John's death, although it was not to be Lennon's swan song.Bruce Springsteen has released three albums since 1980;

the now-defunct weekly 7 Days described her as the decade's ``premier celebrity civil defendant.''In October, a barefoot Ono greeted a visitor to the Dakota in a high-ceilinged first-floor room with white carpet and black onyx walls.Curled up on a chair, she serenely sipped herbal tea from a mug decorated with a Lennon drawing of John and Yoko with the inscription, ``Grow Old With Me.''The mug is one of an assortment of Lennon collectibles available (by appointment only) from Bag One Arts Inc., the entity that controls reproductions of Lennon's art work.``People would ask if we had anything in color,'' says Lynne Clifford, who runs Bag One for Yoko.Lithographs that sold for $400 four years ago have increased as much as 10 times in value, she says, and new ones cost between $600 and $700.Although Bag One's gallery a few blocks from the Dakota deals primarily in lithographs, it also sells the collectibles, including $3 laminated bags that bear Lennon's drawings.The foundation, established by Lennon and Ono before John's death, has contributed to causes ranging from a home for drug addicted children to bulletproof vests for police officers.\",\n"," 416: \"The Hubble Space Telescope was awakened from its self-induced sleep today but it was still without the use of its high-speed antennas, and its science instruments were on hold, unable to begin any observations.``We are out of the `safe-mode' right now,'' said Steve Terry, a supervisor of the engineers controlling the telescope.Discovery's astronauts, meanwhile, packed their gear for a return to Earth Sunday, made some last-minute observations of Earth and talked with ground-based reporters about their flight.Pilot Charles Bolden said he was especially upbeat about the widespread public awareness of the telescope, which is expected eventually to look back 14 billion light years _ nearly to the birth of the universe.The telescope's big eye has remained open, but Hubble had been in a ``safe mode'' with all motion stopped because of earlier problems in linking the high-speed dish antennas with a relay satellite.Terry said that even in the safe mode, one of the tape recorders in the telescope reads telemetry signals from all its systems and that these would be played to Earth and analyzed when the antennas are working properly.Engineers are able to send commands to the telescope via its secondary antennas but the communications system is not useful for scientific data, which must be transmitted at a high rate of speed.Shortly after 6 a.m. EDT, controllers at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., completed a series of commands that took the telescope out of its safe mode and then began to run a 12-hour computer program to monitor Hubble's health.It will take another day before the $1.5 billion telescope is operating the way it was supposed to at this point in the startup process, said Hubble deputy project manager Jean Olivier.The telescope problems have put the flight center several days behind, but the five astronauts who deployed it earlier this week were sticking to their schedule.Landing is scheduled for 9:48 a.m. EDT Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., but flight controllers were keeping a close watch on the weather.The shuttle carries enough supplies to stay in orbit three days beyond Sunday if necessary, NASA said.``The song was selected in honor of Hubble Space Telescope, which is now open for business,'' said Mission Control commentator James Hartsfield.Shriver and pilot Charles Bolden were to run through a series of tests to make certain the shuttle's computers and control jets were ready for return to Earth.The crew deployed Hubble on Wednesday but they had stayed close to the telescope in case there was trouble opening the aperture door.Mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan were prepared to perform a space walk today to crank it open in orbit 380 miles above Earth.But that proved unnecessary when the door was opened Friday morning, exposing the telescope's finely polished 94.5-inch eye to starlight for the first time.Two of Hubble's four position-stabilizing gyroscopes stopped working when the door opened, but engineers later got them back on line.The gyroscopes were knocked out by the motion and that, too, kept the telescope in the safe mode, said Dave Drachlis, director of orbital verifications at Goddard.A colleague, Steve Terry, said Hubble's systems were set at conservative limits for the first operations and that caused many malfunctions.Hubble is designed with safe modes so it can be ``the master of its own destiny'' in case contact with an orbiting communications system is lost for extended periods, Terry said.NASA had planned to release its first test image from the telescope on Tuesday, showing an open star cluster in the constellation Carina.The telescope, named for the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, will enable astronomers over its 15-year working lifetime to look back 14 billion years and possibly determine the age of the universe.\",\n"," 418: \"Ground controllers at the Goddard Space Flight Center finally made contact today with the two main antennas on the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope after trying for more than six hours to lock on.Applause erupted in the Hubble control center in Greenbelt, Md., as the glitch that marred Hubble's first full day in space was solved.Engineers had said all along they believed the antennas were working all right and that the problem was in incorrectly pointing either the satellite or the TDRS, an orbiting communications satellite that acts as a switchboard.In the successful attempt, they nearly doubled the width of the antennas' beams to take in more territory, from a sweep of 6.2 degrees to 10.8 degrees.Space shuttle Discovery was 46 miles away, available to remedy certain problems.Steve Terry, director of a team calibrating various aspects of the telescope, said the first outage was caused by human error and was not a serious problem.It began between 1 and 1:30 a.m. EDT and lasted 45 minutes to an hour, he said.The second failure occurred at 6:44 a.m. when controllers attempted to send a signal to the telescope's two high-gain antennas through the TDRS.The telescope, embarking on a 15-year search for new worlds, was released from the shuttle's cargo bay Wednesday after a last-minute snag that almost sent two astronauts on an emergency spacewalk.Mission Control awakened the crew early today with a loud rendition of the song ``Shout,'' a fraternity house favorite.After Wednesday's deployment, Shriver gently backed Discovery away from the telescope and put the shuttle through a series of maneuvers, the last one completed this morning, to ``park'' Discovery in orbit 46 miles behind Hubble.NASA's most expensive unmanned spacecraft _ as the greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo raised a small telescope to his eyes nearly 400 years ago.Discovery and its five astronauts will follow the telescope while controllers at the Goddard center make sure Hubble is operating properly, such as responding to directional commands.The next milestone is Friday, when the telescope's 10-foot aperture door is to be opened, exposing the finely polished 94.5-inch mirror to starlight.Then on Tuesday, NASA expects to release the first image from the telescope: an open star cluster in the constellation Carina.If the aperture door doesn't open properly, Discovery could return to the telescope so two astronauts could perform a spacewalk to fix it.Hubble project manager Fred Wojtalik said the telescope would be tested today for its ability to maneuver before the aperture door is opened.On Wednesday, mission specialist Steve Hawley used the shuttle's 50-foot robot arm to gently grasp the 12{-ton telescope and hoist it from the cargo bay.One of the telescope's solar arrays unreeled from its mast as expected and started providing power to the telescope's batteries, which otherwise had only eight hours of charge.By the final attempt, astronauts Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan were in their space suits in the airlock, 30 minutes away from taking tools in hand and going on an outer-space maintenance call.The 8{-hour procedure was performed 380 miles above Earth, 70 miles higher than any shuttle has ever flown.Astronomers hope to use the telescope to look back to almost the beginning of the time, studying stars and galaxies so distant their light has taken 14 billions years to reach Earth.The telescope originally was scheduled for launch in 1983 but was delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident.Discovery, which blasted into orbit Tuesday, is scheduled to land Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.\",\n"," 420: \"Discovery's astronauts overcame balky equipment to send the Hubble Space Telescope floating free from the shuttle today on a 15-year quest for secrets of the universe.The $1.5 billion telescope began orbiting Earth every 97.3 minutes at an altitude of 380 miles _ high above the atmosphere, which has limited the view of ground-based telecopes.The final hours before its release were a nightmare for ground controllers as they commanded the unfurling of two solar panels that power the telescope's instruments.The deployment of the two 39-foot panels allowed sun power to flow into the telescope's batteries, relieving worries that they would use up their eight-hour charge.Before astronaut Steve Hawley was able to lift the 12{-ton telescope from the cargo bay with the shuttle's mechanical arm, its instruments had to be disconnected from the shuttle's power and shifted over to the batteries.``Precisely one day after lifting off from Launch Pad 39B at Kennedy Space Center, the Hubble Space Telescope is ready to fly on its own,'' Mission Control's Jeffrey Carr said.Astronauts Kathryn Sullivan and Bruce McCandless put on spacesuits and entered an airlock in order to be ready to walk outside and pull out the array had mechanical deployment of the solar panels failed.Cameras aboard Discovery showed the telescope, being held at the end of a 50-foot crane, reflecting sunlight from its silver surface and a turning Earth in the background.Earlier this morning, Discovery commander Loren J. Shriver maneuvered the shuttle into its deployment position, with its nose pointed toward the sun.That was to put the telescope's solar arrays, once unfurled, at the proper angle to quickly start collecting energy and protect the telescope's fixed star trackers while the instrument was being held above the payload bay.Discovery is in orbit 380 miles above Earth, 70 miles higher than any previous shuttle.``For those technically inclined this morning, I'd like to pass on the quote of the day from the on-board astronomer (Hawley), something to the effect that the big marble sure looks far away today,'' Shriver said.The five astronauts' busy day began on a musical note early this morning as Mission Control played a song called ``Space is Our World,'' written by members of Discovery's training team and a Houston-area group, Private Numbers.Controllers monitoring the telescope at Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland said Tuesday that no problems had been detected so far aboard Hubble, the most expensive and complex unmanned spacecraft ever built.The Hubble telescope, delayed by technical problems and the 1986 Challenger accident, has waited seven years to take its place in space.Hubble will allow astronomers to study stars and galaxies so distant their light has taken 14 billion years to reach Earth.It is expected to provide clues to the age and size of the universe, and it may solve the mysteries of quasars, pulsars and black holes and even find stars with planets that could conceivably support life.The 24,250-pound telescope is 43 feet long and 14 feet in diameter, about the size of a railroad tank car.It is named for the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, whose discovery during the 1920s that the universe is expanding gave rise to the Big Bang theory that the universe was created by a tremendous explosion 10 billion to 20 billion years ago.\",\n"," 424: \"Jubilant astronomers saw decades of work take wing Tuesday as the Hubble Space Telescope was boosted high above Earth to launch ``a great adventure for mankind.''Charles Robert O'Dell, a Rice University space physicist who has worked 19 years on Hubble, said seeing it hurled into orbit aboard the shuttle capped an experience that was ``comparable to raising a child.Colin Norman, a physics and astronomy professor at Johns Hopkins University and academic affairs director of the Space Telescope Science Institute there, called the launch ``the perfect start to a great adventure for mankind.The $1.5 billion telescope originally was scheduled for launch in 1983 but remained grounded by technical problems and the Challenger explosion.Two weeks ago when hundreds of scientists crowded into the Kennedy Space Center, the launch was scrubbed four minutes before liftoff.There were times when we were elated'' about Hubble's progress, said William H. Jeffreys, a University of Texas astronomer and Hubble's astrometry project leader.Ed Weiler, NASA program scientist for Hubble, said watching the liftoff was ``a double whammy'' because ``it was my first shuttle launch and the launch of the HST.\",\n"," 429: \"The mother of a 12-year-old girl swept away by a flash flood was clinging to hope that her daughter was alive but perhaps unable to get home, a family friend said Saturday.Janice Trigg's daughter, Kerri, was among nearly three dozen still missing Saturday night, two days after the floods hit eastern Ohio.Searchers for the missing used trained dogs to sniff through the rubble and along the banks of the Wegee and Pipe creeks, which empty into the Ohio River, in an effort that stretched five miles south of this town.Workers also sifted through debris that collected at the Hannibal locks and dam on the Ohio River, about 25 miles south.Relatives of the missing were staying with friends and family, said the Rev. Robert Gracey, who was counseling flood victims at a school turned into a relief center.Kerri had been playing at a friend's house when the one-story home suddenly was washed away in the flood Thursday night.The friend, 9-year-old Amber Colvin, was swept down Wegee Creek and into the Ohio River, but survived a seven-mile ordeal by clinging to logs.She said she last saw Kerri when the two, alone in the house, jumped into a bathtub for safety in the storm.Deanna Hulderman, 48, said she and her husband, Clancey, were pulled under by Wegee Creek flood water at a bar but were reunited about a half-hour later.Mrs. Hulderman said she, her husband and about seven others were in the 3Ks bar when a wall collapsed and water rushed through.Kathy Schramm, 37, said she, her husband and their two

in about an hour.``It created a wall of water,'' said Jim Williams of the Ohio Emergency Management Agency.The raging waters knocked homes off their foundations and washed away a bar filled with people in Shadyside, an Appalachian Mountain foothill town.Belmont County Sheriff's Department spokeswoman Judy Phillips said a Shadyside bar full of people was washed away when water caved in the back wall.Shadyside Fire Chief Mark Badia said rescuers pulled people from three cars in Wegee Creek, which flows through Shadyside and into the Ohio River.The Ohio departments of transportation and natural resources, the State Highway Patrol, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio and the American Red Cross are assisting state government in assessing the damage, Ohio Emergency Management Agency

Department and other agencies evacuated residents in low-lying areas of Newark and the neighboring village of Marne, said Wayne Tresemer, Licking County Disaster Services director.He said water was standing up to 5 feet deep in some streets on the city's east side, and the Newark Fire Department and other agencies used boats to evacuated some residents.Licking County was already among 14 Ohio counties covered in a disaster declaration issued by President Bush for storms earlier this month, and people who suffered losses from Thursday night's storms will also be eligible for assistance, Ms. Gilg said.In Jefferson County, 50 to 60 residents were evacuated in Adena, where water was 6 to 8 feet deep in streets because of creek flooding.Two inches of rain caused flooding in Franklin County

Wegee Creek, one of two creeks that overflowed in Thursday night's flash flood.By midmorning, the muddy creek was nearly crossing a road about three miles upstream from where the floods inflicted the most damage.The body found this morning was in the Ohio River near Moundsville, W.Va., about 10 miles south of Shadyside, according to Chuck Vogt, Belmont County coroner's investigator.The number of names on the list of missing dropped from 18 to 14 with the identities of three victims and a call by one person alerting authorities that she was safe, Vogt said.Officials said Friday that 60 people were missing; some of those later were found dead, while others notified authorities that they were safe and officials learned that still more had moved out of the area.Wegee and Pipe creeks overflowed during storms that dumped 5{ inches of rain in 3{ hours.Rainwater running down hillsides had forced debris into the creeks and formed dams at bridges spanning them, Shadyside Fire Chief Mark Badia said.The debris broke loose, and that's when we got three big gushes of water,'' Badia said.The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it will open an office Tuesday in Shadyside to

of bodies wrapped in white shrouds, damaged hospital wards packed with survivors.Medical teams in India carried medicine and other supplies to overcrowded hospitals and the army was deployed to help search for victims.The hardest hit appeared to be Dharan, a sparsely populated border region where Thapa said at least 131 people died.He said 50,000 to 60,000 houses were destroyed in the Dharan district alone.``Ninety percent of the remaining houses are cracked,'' Shahi said, adding that most of the damage was to modern houses of stone and older houses from mud and bricks.Rail tracks sank into the soggy ground and bridges over rising rivers cracked, paralyzing train service and road travel in many parts of the devastated areas.There were reports that 50 people were injured, most by jumping from their houses during the quake.Witnesses in Darbhanga, an Indian city of 800,000 about 45 miles south of the epicenter, said the only warnings were hissing sounds, rattling doors and cracking windows.More than 25,000 houses were flattened in Darbhanga, as well as the districts of Munger and Madhubani, Indian officials said.Officials said at least 45 people died, but it was not

of giving relief supplies only to his own supporters.Reports of damage and devastation continued to arrive from remote parts of Nepal on Friday, and the Home Affairs Ministry updated its confirmed death toll to 704.Sunday's earthquake registered 6.5 on the Richter scale, which records energy released by a tremor according to ground motion measured by a seismograph.Dhaubanjar said he saw about 40 people rounded up by police Thursday night after Hyanju's beating death.As Hyanju's body was taken through the winding streets of Bhaktapur, a 12th-century town of ancient Hindu temples, thousands of the town's 50,000 people jammed streets, temple steps and the balconies of brick and mud houses.Pashupati Rana, one of several Cabinet ministers who marched in the funeral procession, said several

meteorologists say.Hugo blasted the eastern Caribbean and the Carolinas with 135 mph winds this past week, killing at least 41 people.That made it among the 12 strongest hurricanes this century to hit the United States, the National Hurricane Center's Miles Lawrence said today.Gilbert, whose winds reached 180 mph, tore up the Caribbean last year, killing 300 and causing $2 billion damage.Gilbert seems to be about the upper limit of a hurricane with current ocean temperatures, said Kerry Emanuel of the meteorology department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.But if the seas warm up, say by 3 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit, ``the wind speeds might be 25 percent higher _ which means the destructive force would be more like 50 percent higher,'' he said.Stephen Schneider, deputy director of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Denver, said his research suggests the warming trend is already here.Schneider, an expert on the greenhouse effect and author of a new book ``Global Warming,'' said six of the 10 hottest years in the last 100 occurred in the 1980s.Hugo demonstrated the effect of warm Atlantic waters when its winds jumped from 105 mph to 135 mph as it passed over the Gulf Stream before hitting the East Coast, Schneider said.Emanuel said if the ocean temperature climbs, moderate hurricanes of the future could grow to Gilbert's strength _ and future Gilberts will be even stronger.Gilbert was so strong that Bob Sheets, director of the national hurricane center, said forecasters may have to use an intensity scale of 1-6 in the future, instead of the current 1-5, with five the highest.The computer models Schneider uses show that in a worst-case scenario, over the next 100 years the world's temperature could jump by 10 degrees if carbon dioxide and methane gas _ which both contribute to the greenhouse effect _ continue to pour into the atmosphere unchecked.\",\n"," 491: 'The two dominant home and automobile insurers in the Carolinas said Tuesday that they expect to be hit with about $600 million in claims from Hurricane Hugo.Such heavy losses suggest that the storm will be the most expensive ever for the insurance industry.State Farm Insurance Co. expects claims as high as $400 million in South Carolina, where it insures one out of every five homes, spokesman Jerry Parsons said.The Bloomington, Ill.-based company is also projecting an additional $100 million in claims from storm damage in North Carolina and Virginia, he said.Additionally, Nationwide Insurance Co. said it expects claims close to $100 million, more than triple the $31 million that the company paid for damages caused by Hurricane Elena when it swept through Florida, Alabama and Mississippi in 1985.\"Our previous all-time high was in 1983, when we paid $165 million in comparable claims for Hurricane Alicia, which struck Galveston and Houston.Officials said property damage from Hugo escalated because the storm scored a direct hit on Charleston and then, instead of heading out to sea, veered northwest, hitting other population centers, including Charlotte, N.C.Nationwide, based in Columbus, Ohio, is the biggest home and auto insurance in North Carolina, where damage was unexpectedly high, and is the third-largest insurer in South Carolina.Although claims adjusters are still tallying the losses, there is now little doubt that overall damage to insured property will far exceed the record $752.5 million in claims paid by the industry after Hurricane Frederic struck Mississippi and Alabama in 1979, Parsons said.For example, Nationwide said it would be responsible for up to $30 million in claims, while its reinsurers would cover up to $150 million in damages.Reinsurers -- which share a portion of the risk on an insurance policy in exchange for part of the premium income -- typically spread their risk over many hundreds of companies.Analysts said most of the claims will be borne by mutual insurance companies, which are owned by policyholders, but they noted that losses from Hurricane Hugo would also affect the short-term earnings of some publicly traded companies.Continental Corp. said it expects to report a pretax charge of $50 million for the third quarter, reflecting its net exposure to damages from the storm.Ghose said Shearson may also cut its third-quarter and annual earnings projections for Cigna Corp., USF&amp;G Corp. and Lincoln National Corp., which are expected to suffer hurricane-related losses equal to about 10% of expected full-year earnings.Overall 1989 catastrophic losses for the industry now total about $1.6 billion, and analysts expect Hugo to make this year the costliest.Billions of dollars in losses from Hugo and other catastrophes this year would have \"a significant impact on excess capital,\" he said, causing insurance firms to raise prices shortly.',\n"," 492: \"Damage from Hurricane Hugo, which stormed through the Carolinas and the Caribbean last week, will reduce third-quarter earnings for several insurers.New York-based American International Group Inc. expects net losses related to Hugo to reduce pretax earnings between $35 million and $45 million.Analysts said AIG has told them that it must cover the first $35 million of losses and that its reinsurance agreements will cover the bulk of the remaining damages.St. Paul Cos., based in St. Paul, Minn, said the pretax cost of Hugo shouldn't exceed $50 million.Udayan Ghose, an insurance industry analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York, estimates that Cigna's third-quarter per-share earnings could be reduced by between 50 cents and 65 cents a share on an after-tax basis.That would wipe out 35% to 40% of his $1.40-a-share earnings estimate for the third quarter.State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. said its State Fire &amp; Casualty Co. unit estimates claim payments from Hugo will exceed $400 million in South Carolina alone, far surpassing the company's record payout for a single disaster.When damages in North Carolina and Virginia are added, the company said, the payments will exceed $500 million.It said that is more than three times the previous record of $165 million set by Hurricane Alicia, which hit the Houston-Galveston, Texas, area in 1983.\",\n"," 493: 'John Major, who was endorsed by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher as her successor and heir, was elected today as leader of the Conservative Party and will become prime minister.Major fell two votes short of the needed majority, but his opponents conceded defeat and Conservative Party officials declared him elected.Major, 47, her chancellor of the Exchequer, is the youngest person to be elected Britain\\'s prime minister since the 19th Century.\"It is a very exciting thing to become leader of the Conservative Party, and particularly exciting, I think, to follow one of the most remarkable leaders the Conservative Party has ever had,\" Major said.She could continue to represent Finchley in the House of Commons, enter the House of Lords, write her memoirs or enter business.We are going to unite totally and absolutely and we\\'re going to win the next general election,\" said Major, who emerged smiling from his residence at 11 Downing St.Major won 185 votes, former Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine had 131 votes and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd had 56 votes in a secret ballot election among Tory members of Parliament.\"I congratulate John Major and thank him for a first-class campaign, fought without rancor or bitterness, which I believe lays the basis for the unity of our party,\" Heseltine said moments after the vote was announced.Within minutes, Cranley Onslow, chairman of the Conservative Party committee that supervised the election, announced that another ballot was not required and that Major was elected.Thatcher left her residence at 10 Downing Street to congratulate Major, who as chancellor of the Exchequer is her next-door neighbor at No. 11.Queen Elizabeth II will send for Major and ask him to form a Cabinet after Thatcher has handed in her seals of office at Buckingham Palace on Wednesday morning.Major was elected to Parliament in 1979, was appointed foreign secretary and then chancellor of the Exchequer last year.He attracted support from prominent figures on the right wing of the Conservative Party, although his friends insisted that Major\\'s own views are more liberal than many supposed.Born March 29, 1943, the son of a circus performer, he left school at 16 and was a laborer and at one time a welfare recipient.Major became a banker and a Conservative Party activist and was elected to Parliament in the first Thatcher victory of 1979.He emerged as a possible heir-apparent when Thatcher appointed him foreign secretary in July, 1989, and then chancellor of the Exchequer three months later.',\n"," 494: 'John Major, the 47-year-old chancellor of the exchequer who rose out of one of London\\'s toughest neighborhoods and the unemployment line, was selected Tuesday as Britain\\'s next prime minister.Major, whose father was once a circus trapeze artist, was elected leader of the Conservative Party to replace Margaret Thatcher, whose sudden resignation under pressure last week surprised the nation.Thatcher formally presents her resignation today to Queen Elizabeth II, who will then ask Major to form a new government.The Conservatives\\' choice of Major, a Thatcher protege, came after a battle pitting him against two other contenders for the party leadership, former Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd.The three-way race took shape last week when Thatcher, stunned by Heseltine\\'s strong showing in the first-round voting for party leader, resigned.In the secret, second-round balloting among the 372 Tory members of the House of Commons on Tuesday, Major got 185 votes -- two shy of the total he needed for an outright victory.But as party members began preparing themselves for a Thursday runoff between Major and Heseltine, the runner-up, both Heseltine, with 131 votes, and Hurd, with 56, threw their support to Major.Thatcher said she was \"thrilled\" by Major\\'s victory, adding that he was her personal favorite among the three contenders.Major becomes Britain\\'s 18th prime minister and the youngest in this century.His election ensures the unity of the fractured Conservative Party, which now has become the favorite to defeat the opposition Labor Party in the next general election.Appearing outside his official residence at No. 11 Downing St., next to the prime minister\\'s, Major declared Tuesday evening, \"We are going to unite totally and absolutely, and we are going to win the next election.\"When the results of Tuesday\\'s vote were announced about 6:20 p.m., both Heseltine and Hurd said that they would vote for Major in the scheduled third runoff ballot on Thursday and advised their supporters to do the same.\"The President said he looked forward to working with Major and to maintaining the special relationship\" with Britain, said White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater.The prime minister had picked Major from among \"backbenchers\" -- those who are not party leaders -- as someone to watch several years ago and regarded him, aides said, as \"a man of the people.\"Thatcher may accept a peerage in the House of Lords as a hereditary countess, friends said, since earldoms (the male equivalent) are the traditional award to former prime ministers.Major is a high school dropout who made his name in banking before winning a seat in the House of Commons in 1979.He has few enemies and is regarded as a leader who can unify the party and, associates said Tuesday night, lead the Tories to victory in the next election, which must be held within 18 months, at a time of the party\\'s choosing.He is not expected to introduce any major new policies but will take a more sympathetic view toward Britain\\'s role in the European Community and has promised to review the controversial community charge, the so-called poll tax introduced by Thatcher.Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock, who likely will face Major in the next national election, immediately labeled him \"more of the same\" in the Thatcher mold.Cunningham pointed out that 187 members of Major\\'s own party, a majority in the House of Commons, voted against him Tuesday.With 185 votes in the three-way race, Major did not gain as many as the 202 votes Thatcher won Nov. 20, when Heseltine was her sole opponent.But in that vote, under the party\\'s complicated rules, she needed a majority plus 15% and she fell four votes short.She also appeared to take an anti-European attitude toward her 11 partners in the European Community, which caused her long-serving Cabinet colleague and deputy prime minister, Geoffrey Howe, to resign and deliver a witheringly critical resignation speech.That speech led Heseltine, who had walked out of the Cabinet in 1984 in a dispute over how to aid of a defense contractor, to challenge Thatcher for the leadership in that first ballot last Tuesday.Her closest advisers reported that her support in the House of Commons was eroding, friends said, so she decided to resign rather than risk the humiliation of a defeat at the hands of one of her own colleagues.Many Tories in Parliament were angry at Heseltine for his role in bringing down Thatcher, who had won three national elections during her 15 years as Conservative Party leader.',\n"," 500: '[Text] Cabinet ministers rallied behind John Major yesterday by

\"posturing\" before the damaging retreat last week by the Prime Minister over Britain\\'s veto powers in the enlarged European Union.The leadership is hoping that over the Easter recess the Conservative constituencies will urge their MPs to stop the damaging in-fighting which they believe is overshadowing the Government\\'s fightback on the economy, law and order and education.That message was reinforced by three Cabinet ministers who broke their Easter Sundays to support Mr Major.But he will be carrying on a 20- to 30-year programme begun in 1979 through to the next general

ideas, ambitions and ability to take Britain to success in the 21st century,\" Lord Wakeham said.Their calls were described as \"ritualistic\" by one leading right-wing Tory MP.If a challenge does take place, they will press Mr Portillo to stand to secure key commitments, including no British entry into a single European currency.Three of the Tory MPs who have been rumoured as possible stalking

security zone separating rebel South Ossetia from the rest of Georgia.Georgian national guards occupied similar positions on their side of the border and pulled out all their men from the South Ossetian capital of Tskhinvali.But Itar-Tass news agency said gunfire overnight near the city killed four civilians and injured two others, underscoring the difficulties facing the operation.The mission was the first peace-keeping attempt anywhere in the former Soviet Union, whose disintegration last year has prompted waves of bloodletting in ethnic flashpoints from the Romanian to the Afghan

republic of Armenia, Radio Russia said five civilians had died overnight in Azerbaijani shelling, the latest victims of a four-year undeclared war which has killed 2,000 people.Russia and Georgia were cautiously optimistic that Ossetia could be the first region of the former Soviet Union where armed conflict could be resolved with the help of 'political measures and actions'.South Ossetia is part of Georgia but wants to unite with neighbouring North Ossetia, which was assigned to Russia by Stalin.Hundreds have been killed since 1990 in fighting between Georgians and Ossetians.The greatest

of casualties from today's firefight at the line, which divides Kashmir between Pakistan and India.The nations have twice gone to war over the Himalayan state, in 1948 and again in 1965.The former princely state was divided between the two nations after British colonial rule ended in 1947.Relations between the neighbors have become increasingly strained since Jan. 20 when Indian troops launched

killed three students and wounded several during that confrontation, a Pakistan defence ministry spokesman said.The two armies also exchanged gunfire for about 30 minutes before calm was restored.A Paksitan army captain, who said he witnessed the firefight, said unlike the occasional shootings in the past, Indian soldiers appeared to be aiming at Pakistani troops.The western observer said Sunday's shooting of the Pakistan soldier appeared to back up that assertion.In another sign of increased tensions, Pakistani and Indian officers are no longer accompanying United Nations' military

of the alleged victims.Many of the interviews were conducted at an early stage of the sexual abuse investigation by MacFarlane, a social worker and director of the Child Sexual Abuse Center at Children's Institute International.MacFarlane said Thursday she still believes children from the school had been molested and that they had not fabricated their accounts of abuse.``If the CII tapes had not been entered into evidence and I had not seen them, I could have believed the children a little more,'' juror Brenda Williams said.But MacFarlane said that the interviewing techniques were

Stuart murder case in Boston, which has CBS and The Fries Co. racing to produce the first docudrama -- McMartin creates some tricky legal and moral problems.The jury\\'s deadlock on 13 counts creates

Wisconsin and the Missouri.The Iowa was headed back to its home port at Norfolk, Va., while the bodies of the dead were flown to the military mortuary at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware and families of the battleship's 1,600 crewmen waited to learn whether their relatives were among the dead.At the White House, chief of staff John Sununu announced President Bush will attend a memorial service Monday for the victims in Norfolk.A spokesman for the Atlantic Fleet and the ship's former captain both said the explosion in the No. 2 turret could have been triggered by red-hot debris from earlier

Powell Carter, commander in chief of the Atlantic Fleet, was on the dock to greet the vessel.The Navy kept the news media about 300 yards from the families, and reporters were not allowed to talk with the families or the crewmen.The violence and power of the turret explosion was shown in an amateur videotape released by the Navy on Sunday.The detonation, which appears to blast away the gasket-like rubber ``bloomers'' that seal the turret's gun slits, is followed by a jet of intense fire and thick smoke from the front and base of the gunhouse.``Our faith helps us to handle what science cannot answer, the mystery of death.''A red rose, a yellow ribbon with the number 47 on it and a book containing the names of the dead were taken to the altar.Fitzgerald said the Iowa tragedy and that of a recently lost Soviet submarine ``put political differences aside and unite the human family as one.''On Monday morning, President Bush will lead a memorial service in a base hangar that can accommodate 3,000 people.The Pentagon said it happened before the middle 16-inch gun of the three-gun turret had been fired.The guns, the largest on any ship at sea, use six 110-pound bags of black powder to fire a 2,700-pound projectile up to 23 miles.But Navy teams who entered the turret immediately after the blast found the No. 2 gun's breech open and undamaged, with the practice projectile that the gun was to have fired still there, The New York Times reported Sunday.This indicated the explosion occurred while the powder bags were still being loaded into the gun, the Times said, citing unidentified sources.Navy gunnery officers believe the explosion occurred when the bags were being transferred from a powder hoist to the gun, the newspaper said.They said flame and hot gases from the blast went down the hoist to the lowest deck; if the transfer of powder to the guns had been complete, the hoist would have been sealed off.The Iowa and its sister ships, the battleships Missouri, New Jersey and Wisconsin, were commissioned during World War II and mothballed after the Korean War.Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Sunday that the administration plans to keep all four battleships in the fleet despite the explosion.\",\n"," 565: 'The scarred battleship Iowa made a somber return Sunday to its home port, where about 3,000 family members and friends of the crew welcomed loved ones who escaped an explosion that killed 47 sailors.Sailors in whites with black arm bands lined the rails as the huge vessel docked at the Norfolk Naval Base\\'s Pier 5.Twenty minutes later, families started filing aboard the ship, exchanging tearful embraces with the returning sailors.The explosion Wednesday flashed through the Iowa\\'s No. 2 gun turret, which extends six decks down into the ship.There were 11 survivors inside the turret, all on the lowest deck where they were loading powder from the ship\\'s magazines, the Navy said.Two of the surviving crewmen of No. 2 turret stood on top of the fire-blackened turret as the ship pulled into the pier, with full crews on the ship\\'s two other turrets.The Navy kept the news media about 300 yards from the families, and reporters were not allowed to talk with the families or crewmen.The violence and power of the turret explosion was shown in an amateur videotape released by the Navy on Sunday.The tape was made by an officer on the bridge of the Iowa who wanted to record the firing of the big guns.The detonation, which appears to blast away the gasket-like rubber \"bloomers\" that seal the turret\\'s gun slits, is followed by a jet of intense fire and thick smoke from the front and base of the gunhouse.Churches throughout the area dedicated prayers Sunday morning to the families of Iowa crewmen.A red rose, a yellow ribbon with the number 47 on it and a book containing the names of the dead were taken to the altar.This morning, President Bush will lead a memorial service in a base hangar that can accommodate 3,000 people.The families of the victims were invited, but Navy officials said they did not know how many would attend.The Pentagon said it happened before the middle 16-inch gun of the three-gun turret had been fired.The Iowa and its sister ships, the Missouri, New Jersey and Wisconsin, were commissioned during World War II and mothballed after the Korean War.Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Sunday that he believes the four battleships still \"have merit\" as weapons in the U.S. arsenal and have a future in the modern Navy.On NBC\\'s \"Meet the Press,\" Cheney called the ships \"one way to supplement\" the usefulness of carrier battle groups \"in terms of a show of force and showing the flag.\"\"They were relatively cheap to bring back into service compared to new ships; they\\'re good cruise missile platforms, so I do think they have a role to play.',\n"," 566: \"Thousands of grieving friends and relatives of the fallen 47 crewmen from the battleship USS Iowa gathered quietly Monday and heard President Bush praise their loved ones as ``brothers in eternity.''``We join today in mourning for the 47 who perished, and in fact, for the 11 who survived,'' the president told a packed memorial service at Norfolk Naval Air Station.The president, a World War II Navy pilot, said he was proud to recommission the Iowa in 1984 and said it had earned 11 battle stars in two wars.But with the still-unexplained fire and explosion last Wednesday in the battleship's No. 2 gun turret, he said, ``Fate has written a sorrowful chapter in the history of this great ship.''The Iowa's commander, Capt. Fred P. Moosally, said the turret's crew was the best gun crew on the ship, and called its chief _ Chief Gunner's Mate Reginald Owen Ziegler of Port Gibson, N.Y.Victims' relatives and hundreds of sailors and officers in dress blues were among the 6,000 people crowded into a hangar for the service.As many as 500 Iowa crewmen were unable to attend the service because they were delayed by traffic and were not permitted to enter the hangar because of security measures to protect Bush.The service came a day after the World War II-era battleship eased into its home port, its gun barrels scorched and its 1,500 crewmen at the rails in white uniforms and black armbands in memory of their dead shipmates.Moosally told the crowd of mourners that he remembered the men of turret No. 2.Bush recounted seeing the Iowa off the coast of the Philippines as a naval aviator in World War II, and the great sense of confidence the big ship lent to the fleet.Moosally said the blast occurred just as he was turning to Vice Adm. Jerome Johnson, commander of the 2nd Fleet, to tell him to watch the No. 2 turret because it contained his best crew.Moosally refused to give a definite answer to reporters' questions about whether the damaged turret could be repaired, saying the battleship could operate without it if necessary.All but 11 men in the huge gun turret died almost instantly last Wednesday when the explosion ripped through it.John P. Morse, the Iowa's weapons officer, said the guns were thoroughly inspected the morning of the accident, and Moosally said he had no hesitation about the guns' safety.One of the survivors, Gunner's Mate 3rd Class Kendall L. Truitt, 21, of Tampa, Fla., said that at first the men down in the powder magazine in the lowest level of the turret didn't know anything was wrong.When the men discovered that no one was answering the interior turret communications link, Truitt ordered the powder returned to the magazine and the compartment evacuated.\"}"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":30}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#
